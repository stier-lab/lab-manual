# Facilities

The lab operates across several buildings on campus and at the waterfront. Get your keys and access set up early. Start this process in your first week.

## Getting Keys and Access

### Physical Keys

- **Noble Hall, Bio2:** Get keys through the Bio Storeroom (Kurt Bellefeuille, bellefeu@lifesci.ucsb.edu). Andi Jorgensen or I can submit the key request form on the UCSB website on your behalf before you pick them up.
- **Marine Science Research Building (MSRB):** Contact the MSRB Maintenance Coordinator at msi-building@ucsb.edu or (805) 893-2249 for keys and door access codes.
- **The Point:** Get keys through Christoph Pierre in Building 465, Room 102.

### Digital Keys (ID Card)

## Conference Room Check-out

Reserve rooms via Google Calendar with your @ucsb.edu account. Contact Molly Brzezinski (lab manager) for room-specific booking details.

## Lab Spaces and Daily Operations

### Noble 2224 (Dry Lab)

This is the main lab space for computer work, meetings, and day-to-day operations. It has the shared iMac, a printer, and workspace. Treat it as a shared office. Keep the tables and counters clear of personal clutter so others can work. If you are using the space for a meeting or a committee exam, let the lab know in advance so there are no conflicts. For private meetings (oral exams, committee meetings), put a note on the door.

### Noble Hall Offices

Graduate student offices are on the 2nd floor of Noble. Office assignments are coordinated through Andi Jorgensen. Request both WiFi and Ethernet in your office -- Ethernet makes a real difference for video calls and large file transfers. If your computer lacks an Ethernet port, get a USB-to-Ethernet adapter before your LSCG appointment.

### Sample Storage

- **Freezers:** Label all samples clearly with your name, date, contents, and project. Unlabeled samples will eventually be discarded. Do not overfill freezers -- poor seals cause temperature loss and can ruin everyone's samples. Before you leave the lab (graduation, field season), remove or clearly label any samples you are leaving behind. Coordinate with Molly or another lab member if someone else will continue processing them.
- **Refrigerator:** The lab fridge is for food and drinks only. Do not store chemicals or biological samples in it.
- **Chemical storage:** Chemicals are stored in Noble 2224 per the Chemical Health and Safety Plan (see Required Trainings). When you bring in a new chemical, add the SDS to the binder. Hazardous waste goes in designated containers -- never down the drain.

### Shared Equipment

Shared equipment (microscopes, balances, field gear, dive equipment) is everyone's responsibility. If you use something, return it clean and in working order. If something is broken or running low, report it to Molly or post in the lab Slack channel. Do not assume someone else will notice. Equipment for checkout (cameras, GPS units, etc.) should be signed out and returned promptly.

### The Point and Waterfront Facilities

The Point houses our aquarium and wet lab space. Coordinate with Christoph Pierre for access. Be respectful of shared spaces and other labs that use this area. Keep the tank room and outdoor areas clean.
