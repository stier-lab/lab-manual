# AI Use Policy

## University Policy Context

UCSB does not have a blanket university-wide AI policy. Under current guidance from the Office of Teaching and Learning (May 2023), AI-assistive technology for writing is not allowed in courses, theses, dissertations, or research articles unless the instructor or supervisor permits it. The UCSB Student Conduct Code classifies unauthorized use of AI programs to complete coursework as academic dishonesty.

For research (as opposed to coursework), AI use is governed by your supervisor's policies. The rest of this section covers the Stier Lab policy.

EEMB does not have a department-level AI policy. This lab policy fills that gap.

## Lab Policy on AI Tools

The Stier Lab embraces AI tools as part of our research workflow. Used well, they accelerate literature discovery, improve code quality, and help with brainstorming and writing. Used carelessly, they introduce errors, fabricate citations, and undermine scientific integrity.

### Tools We Use

The lab actively uses the following AI tools:

- **Claude / Claude Code:** For code generation, debugging, data analysis assistance, and writing feedback
- **NotebookLM:** For synthesizing and querying collections of research papers and notes
- **Research Rabbit:** For literature discovery, citation mapping, and finding related papers
- **Other tools as they emerge:** AI tools change rapidly. New tools will be adopted as they prove useful. Discuss with Adrian before integrating a new tool into a published workflow.

### Permitted Uses

- **Literature search and discovery:** Using AI tools to find relevant papers, map citation networks, and summarize bodies of literature
- **Code generation and debugging:** Using AI to write, debug, and improve R, Python, or other analysis code
- **Brainstorming:** Using AI to generate hypotheses, explore experimental designs, or think through analytical approaches
- **Writing assistance:** Using AI for feedback on drafts, improving clarity, restructuring arguments, or overcoming writer's block
- **Data exploration:** Using AI to help visualize data, identify patterns, or suggest appropriate statistical approaches

### Requirements

- **Verify everything.** AI tools hallucinate. They generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information, including fabricated citations. Every factual claim, citation, statistical method, and code output must be independently verified before use.
- **Never use unverified AI output as final text or data.** AI-generated text is a starting point or a tool for revision, not a finished product. AI-generated code must be tested and understood before being incorporated into an analysis pipeline.
- **Cite AI use in publications.** When AI tools contributed to a manuscript (for example, code generation, analysis design, or text revision), disclose this in the Methods or Acknowledgements section following the journal's guidelines. Many journals now have explicit AI disclosure requirements.
- **Understand your code.** If AI generates analysis code for you, you must understand what every line does. You are responsible for the correctness of your analysis, not the AI.
- **Do not input unpublished data into public AI tools without permission.** Some AI tools (particularly web-based ones) retain or train on user inputs. Do not paste unpublished data, manuscripts in preparation, or grant proposals into tools unless you are confident about their data handling policies. When in doubt, use local/private instances or ask Adrian.
- **Coursework rules are separate.** For courses you are taking or TAing, follow the instructor's AI policy. It is often more restrictive than this lab policy. When in doubt, ask the instructor.
- **Theses and dissertations.** Your thesis or dissertation is your scholarly work. AI tools can help with revision, code, and analysis (following the requirements above), but the ideas, arguments, and writing must be substantively yours. The Graduate Division's current guidance treats theses and dissertations like other academic work — unauthorized AI use constitutes academic dishonesty. If you use AI tools in your thesis work, disclose it and discuss the scope with Adrian.

### What AI Cannot Replace

- Your scientific judgment and critical thinking
- Your understanding of the biological system you study
- Your responsibility for the accuracy and integrity of your work
- Peer review, committee feedback, and collegial discussion
- The process of learning to write, analyze, and think independently

### Staying Current

AI capabilities and university policies are evolving rapidly. This policy will be reviewed and updated annually. If you encounter a situation not covered here, ask Adrian.
