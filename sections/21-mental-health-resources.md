# Mental Health Resources

## Why This Is in the Manual

Graduate school is hard. Not in the vague, "everyone says it's tough" sense, but in ways that are well-documented and measurable. Studies consistently find that around 40% of graduate students experience clinically significant anxiety or depression — roughly six times the rate in the general population. Imposter syndrome is pervasive. Burnout is common. These are not signs of personal weakness. They are structural features of the graduate school experience that need to be actively managed.

I include this section not as a formality but because I believe that taking care of yourself is a prerequisite for doing good science. You cannot think clearly, write well, or be a good collaborator if you are running on empty. Seeking help is not a sign that something is wrong with you. It is a sign that you are taking your work and your well-being seriously.

## Recognizing Burnout

Burnout builds gradually. By the time you recognize it, it has usually been developing for months. The three core dimensions are:

- **Exhaustion:** Physical, mental, and emotional depletion that is not resolved by a weekend off. Feeling drained at the end of every day, not just the end of a hard week.
- **Cynicism:** Losing the sense of purpose or meaning in your research. Feeling resentful about tasks you used to find engaging. Distancing yourself from your work and your labmates.
- **Inefficacy:** A sense that nothing you do matters or is good enough. Declining confidence in your ability to succeed.

Other warning signs include persistent procrastination, withdrawing from lab activities or social interactions, difficulty concentrating, chronic fatigue, making more frequent mistakes, and avoiding meetings with your advisor. If several of these feel familiar, please talk to someone — me, a labmate, CAPS, or any of the resources below.

## What I Commit To

- I care about you as a whole person, not just your research output. If you are struggling, I want to know — not to judge, but to help.
- I will not hold it against you if you need time away for your mental health. Treat it the same as physical illness: let me know, take the time you need, and we will figure out the rest.
- I try to model healthy boundaries. When I send an email or Slack message outside business hours, I do not expect a response until the next business day.
- If you come to me with a concern, I will listen and connect you with appropriate resources. I am not a therapist, and I will not pretend to be one. But I will take your concerns seriously and do what I can.

## Work-Life Balance

A few things I believe about sustainability in graduate school:

- Rest is productive. Stepping away from a problem often leads to the insight that hours of grinding did not.
- Vacation is real vacation, not "work from home with a nicer view." Take your time off fully. The lab will still be here when you get back.
- There is no prize for being the last person to leave the building. Consistent, focused work during reasonable hours produces better science than chronic overwork.
- Hobbies, exercise, friendships, and time outdoors are not distractions from your academic career. They sustain it.
