# Technology

This section covers shared computing resources, network access, and tools you will use daily. If you run into technical issues, contact the Life Sciences Computing Group (LSCG) first. See the Valuable Contacts section for details.

## Lab Computer

The lab has a high-power iMac in Noble 2224 with 40 GB RAM. Ask Molly or me for the guest account password. If you need a private account, talk to me. Log out when done. Do not leave personal accounts open.

## Lab Server (Network Attached Storage / NAS)

The Stier Lab NAS is accessible at stier-nas1.eemb.ucsb.edu (on campus or via VPN).

- **Mac:** `smb://stier-nas1.eemb.ucsb.edu`
- **Windows:** `\\stier-nas1.eemb.ucsb.edu`

Authentication uses Active Directory Service (ADS) accounts (ADS\username). Contact the Life Sciences Computing Group for connection help: help@lscg.ucsb.edu (general) or help@lifesci.ucsb.edu (EEMB-specific IT support).

## Internet Access

Connect to LifeSci[BuildingName] for computers and LifeSciGadget for phones. New devices require an LSCG appointment. Email help@lifesci.ucsb.edu (EEMB IT) or visit [lscg.ucsb.edu](https://www.lscg.ucsb.edu/) to submit a request. WiFi can be spotty in Noble, so many people use ethernet. Use your ADS username (usually your last name), not your UCNetID.

## Personal Computers

You will need your own laptop for research, writing, and analysis. If this is a financial hardship, talk to me — there may be options through the department or Graduate Division. The shared lab iMac in Noble 2224 is available for heavy computing tasks, but it is not a substitute for having your own machine.

If your laptop dies or needs repair, the Life Sciences Computing Group has loaner machines. The Graduate Division may also have a loaner program. Do not let a broken computer silently stall your progress for weeks.

## Backing Up Your Computer

Back up your work regularly -- ideally daily. Hard drives fail, laptops get stolen, and coffee gets spilled. Do not keep the only copy of your dissertation on a single device.

- **UCSB Box** provides unlimited cloud storage and is the easiest first line of backup.
- **External hard drives** provide a local backup in case you lose internet access.
- **The lab NAS** is backed up regularly and is a good place to store research data (see Data Management section).
- Use at least two of these. If your work exists in only one location, it is not backed up.

## Software Licenses

The lab maintains licenses for specialized software used on shared and personal machines. License keys and installation records are stored in Google Drive (`Admin > Lab computer information`). If you need access to lab-licensed software, check this folder first before purchasing anything.

**Current lab software (check the folder for the latest list):**

| Software | Used For | Installed On |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Cellsens / Evident | Microscope imaging | Lab iMac (Noble 2224) |
| Adobe Creative Cloud | Figure preparation, posters | Lab iMac |
| R / RStudio | Statistical analysis | Personal machines (free) |
| Microsoft Office | Documents, spreadsheets | Available through UCSB site license |

**UCSB site licenses:** UCSB provides free or discounted access to many software packages through [UCSB Software Licensing](https://www.software.ucsb.edu/). Check here before buying anything. Common free options include Microsoft Office 365, MATLAB, Adobe Creative Cloud (varies by department), and antivirus software.

**Important:** When you install lab-purchased software on any machine, record the license key, installation date, and machine name in the `Lab computer information` folder. License keys are expensive and hard to replace if lost. Do not store them only on the machine where the software is installed — if that machine dies, the key is gone.

**Vendor contacts:** For equipment-specific software issues (microscope cameras, analytical instruments), vendor contact information is in the `Lab computer information` folder. Try the vendor before LSCG — LSCG supports general computing, not specialized scientific instruments.

## Printing

The printer is on the 2nd floor of Noble next to my office. You must be connected to LifeSci Noble. For poster printing, ITST and CNSI charge $40 for a standard 48x36 poster.

## VPN Connection

For off-campus access to UCSB resources, set up the Ivanti Secure Access VPN. This requires Duo multi-factor authentication enrollment. Find setup instructions at [UCSB IT](https://it.ucsb.edu/network-infrastructure-services/ivanti-connect-secure-campus-vpn).
