# Stier Lab Digital Tools

## Google Group / Calendars

Lab email: stierlab@googlegroups.com. The lab has two calendars. "Stier Lab" tracks departmental events, conferences, and holidays. "Stier Lab Availability" shows personal schedules for coordinating meetings.

## Slack

Lab workspace: [stierlab.slack.com](https://stierlab.slack.com). Download the app for your phone. Create topic-specific channels as needed.

## Zotero

This is our preferred citation manager. Create an account at [zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org/) and ask Adrian or labmates for access to the lab group library.

## Google Drive

This is our shared repository for lab materials. Note that UCSB Google Drive storage is limited to 150 GB per account (shared across Gmail, Drive, and Photos). For large datasets, use the lab NAS or UCSB Box instead. Familiarize yourself with the folder structure:

- Admin
- Big Files (DO NOT SYNC)
- Communications
- Funding
- Lab Projects
- People
- Resources

Do not edit files owned by others without permission.

## Social Media and Professional Online Presence

The lab has Instagram and Twitter/X (@oceanrecoveries). Browse previous posts for the tone. You are welcome to post appropriate content. Ask if you have questions about a particular post.

Beyond the lab accounts, consider whether a professional social media presence makes sense for you. Platforms like Bluesky, Twitter/X, and Mastodon can be effective tools for science communication, networking, and building a professional reputation. Many researchers find their collaborators, hear about job openings, and share their work through these channels. If you are interested, go for it.

A few things to keep in mind:

- Anything you post publicly reflects on you, the lab, and UCSB. Be professional.
- Social media can also be a distraction and a source of stress. Use it intentionally, not compulsively. If it is affecting your mental health or productivity, step back.
- You are never required to have a social media presence. Plenty of successful scientists do not use it at all.
