# Authorship Policy

Authorship is one of the primary currencies of academic science. Getting it right matters for careers, relationships, and the integrity of the scientific record. There is no universal standard, but here is how we approach it in this lab.

I want to be candid about this topic because most labs do not talk about it enough. The confusion that results can damage relationships. There is no hard and fast rule for authorship. The norms vary across disciplines, across labs, and even across projects. Your own authorship philosophy will evolve over your career. What follows is where I have landed, but I hold it loosely. I am always willing to talk it through.

## Who Qualifies as an Author?

Authorship should reflect genuine intellectual contribution to the work. At minimum, an author should have contributed to one or more of the following: conception of the idea, study design, data collection, data analysis/interpretation, or writing the manuscript. Simply providing funding, published data (already credited elsewhere), or minor editorial comments does not typically warrant authorship. Those contributions belong in the Acknowledgements.

The line between "acknowledgement" and "authorship" is genuinely hard. I do not think anyone has a clean formula for it. Lab meetings improve everyone's science, but participating in lab meeting does not make you a co-author on every paper discussed there. Writing suggestions are a judgment call. A few comments on phrasing are different from restructuring an argument. Funding alone does not qualify either, even if I wrote the grant that supported the work. These cases require judgment and conversation, not rules. When in doubt, err toward inclusion early in your career. But do not offer authorship so freely that it devalues the substantive contributions of others.

One practical suggestion: keep a running list of who contributed what as a project develops. It is much easier to have an authorship conversation when you can point to a concrete record of contributions. Relying on memory after the paper is written is much harder.

## Authorship Order

I use the "PI is last" convention that is standard in ecology. For papers led by students or post-docs, the first author is the person who led the project and the writing effort. Other authors are listed in decreasing order of contribution, with me typically in the last position as the senior or supervising author. For papers I lead, authors are listed in order of decreasing contribution.

The first author, in consultation with the rest of the team, decides on author order. If there are disagreements, bring them to me and we will work it out together.

## Corresponding and Contact Author

My default is that the first author serves as both the corresponding author and the contact author. It is your project. Own it. You handle the journal correspondence, the reviewer responses, and any post-publication inquiries. This is good practice for your career, and it signals to the field that the work is yours.

There are exceptions. If you are leaving academia and will not maintain an active email, or if you will be unreachable for an extended period (say, a long field season without internet), we can designate someone else. But the default is that the person who led the work is the person the world contacts about it.

## When Adrian Expects to Be a Co-Author

I do not expect to be on every paper that comes out of this lab. I want to be clear about that. If the work is closely tied to one of my grants (using funding I secured, building on questions central to the grant), co-authorship is typical. If your research has grown into something quite distinct from my own program, it does not need to include me. That is fine. I prefer a healthy mentoring relationship over an inflated publication list.

I want to co-author at least one chapter of your dissertation, but it is not required. Here is what I want you to understand: the editorial guidance I give you (reading drafts, suggesting analyses, helping you sharpen arguments) is free. That is part of the job, and it is a part I genuinely love. You never need to worry that asking for feedback creates an obligation. If I am a co-author, I will invest even more energy in the manuscript. But the baseline level of support does not change either way.

## When to Discuss Authorship

- **Early.** Discuss expected authorship when a project is being planned. This is not binding, because contributions change over the life of a project. But it sets expectations and motivates engagement.

- **As the project develops.** Revisit the authorship list as new people contribute or as roles shift. A conversation halfway through is much less awkward than a surprise at the end.

- **Before submission.** Revisit and confirm authorship and order with all co-authors before you hit "submit." This includes conference abstracts, not just journal papers.

- **When things change.** If you are considering adding or removing an author, communicate the rationale to all existing co-authors first.

> **Warning:** Never submit a paper (including conference abstracts) without explicit approval from all listed co-authors. All co-authors should have the opportunity to review the manuscript before submission. Get explicit sign-off on the final version from every author before you click "submit." This applies to conference abstracts too. They are part of the scientific record. If you are unsure whether someone's contribution warrants authorship, ask them. Ask me. Talk about it before it becomes a problem.
