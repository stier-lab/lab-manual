# Travel

UCSB has specific procedures for booking, advances, and reimbursement. These apply to conferences, field sites, and any other university-related travel. Start the process early. Travel paperwork takes longer than you expect. See the Graduate Student Funding section for available travel grants.

## Before You Travel

All university travel requires pre-trip approval. Get written authorization from Adrian (or the appropriate PI for the funding source) before making any arrangements. The approval should include the purpose, dates, destination, estimated cost, and the funding source (FRU/project number) that will be charged. Travelers who fail to obtain prior authorization may be personally liable for expenses.

For grant-funded travel, check whether the sponsor has specific approval requirements. Federal grants often require prior written approval for foreign travel.

## Booking Through Connexxus

Connexxus is UCSB's travel booking portal. Use it for flights, hotels, and rental cars. It automatically applies UC-negotiated discounts and has several practical advantages:

- Your trip is automatically registered with UC's travel insurance (no separate UC Away registration needed).
- Airfare can be direct-billed to the department.
- Rental cars booked through Connexxus include full CDW/LDW insurance coverage.
- UC-negotiated rates are applied automatically.

Access [Connexxus](https://bfs.ucsb.edu/travel_entertainment/travel-planning/connexxus) through the BFS website or through the Travel section of Concur. You must be an active UCSB employee. If you book outside Connexxus, you must separately register your trip at [UC Away](https://www.ucop.edu/risk-services-travel/registering.html) to activate travel insurance.

## Rental Cars

Rental cars require prior department approval and will not be reimbursed without it. When booking, use the UC contract IDs: Hertz (72130), Enterprise (XZ32A01), or National (through Connexxus). These contracts include full insurance coverage — decline all additional insurance at the counter. UC will not reimburse purchased additional insurance.

If using a personal vehicle instead, mileage reimbursement is $0.725/mile (as of January 2026). Total mileage cost should not exceed the cost of a rental car or airfare.

## Meals and Lodging

For domestic travel, UCSB reimburses actual meal costs (not a flat per diem) up to a daily maximum. Current maximum meal rates (as of September 2025, including tax and service):

- Breakfast: $34
- Lunch: $59
- Dinner: $103

Receipts are required for individual meals exceeding $75. Itemized receipts are always required for lodging. The domestic lodging cap is $333/night (excluding taxes and mandatory hotel fees).

For international travel, you may claim a flat per diem for meals and lodging. Look up foreign per diem rates at the [U.S. Department of State](https://aoprals.state.gov/web920/per_diem.asp) website. For domestic rates by city, check the [GSA per diem rate tables](https://www.gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates).

## Travel Advances

If you do not have a UC Travel & Entertainment card, you can request a cash advance for trip expenses. Submit the request through Concur between 10 and 30 days before your trip (check with your department — MSI requires 15 business days, some departments require 30 days). Only one advance per trip is allowed.

After your trip, you must clear the advance within 14 days by submitting a Concur expense report, even if you have no additional expenses. If your expenses were less than the advance, reimburse the university for the difference. Advances not settled within 120 days are treated as taxable income.

## Reimbursement

Submit your expense report through Concur within 45 days of your return. Some departments have shorter internal deadlines (EEMB uses 30 days — submit to Andi Jorgensen with an itemized receipt). Reimbursements submitted after 45 days may be reported as taxable income.

Keep itemized receipts for everything. Processing typically takes 1-3 weeks once a fully approved report reaches BFS, but this varies.

## International Travel

Beyond standard booking and reimbursement, international travel requires additional steps:

- **Travel insurance:** Book through Connexxus (auto-registers) or register manually at [UC Away](https://www.ucop.edu/risk-services-travel/registering.html). This activates UC's global travel insurance, which covers emergency medical evacuation, out-of-country medical expenses, and security extraction.
- **Export controls:** If traveling to a sanctioned country (Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, etc.) or carrying research equipment or data that may be subject to export controls, contact UCSB's Export Control Officer (exportcontrol@research.ucsb.edu) before traveling.
- **International students (F-1/J-1):** Submit a travel signature request via UCSBGlobal at least 5-10 business days before travel. Ensure your I-20 or DS-2019 has a valid travel signature from OISS.

## If Plans Change

Cancel reservations in compliance with the vendor's cancellation terms. Refundable deposits must be returned to the university. Connexxus bookings on UC-negotiated contracts generally include more flexible change and cancellation terms. Contact your departmental travel coordinator for guidance on specific rebooking situations.

## Travel Emergencies

If you have an emergency while traveling on university business, call the 24/7 assistance hotline:

- **From the US/Canada:** 1-855-327-1420
- **International (collect):** 1-630-694-9804

Coverage includes emergency medical evacuation, out-of-country medical care, security extraction, and lost document replacement. Coverage applies when you are 100+ miles from home on UC-affiliated business. Make sure your trip is registered before departure.
