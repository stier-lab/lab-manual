# Purchasing, Shipping, and Reimbursement

You will need to order supplies regularly. The system has some quirks, but it becomes routine after a few times. Ask a senior lab member or me before placing an order if you are unsure.

## Before You Order

Before placing any order, you need to know the funding source. Each purchase must be charged to a specific account (identified by a Financial Reporting Unit and Project code in the Oracle system). Molly Brzezinski (lab manager) or I will tell you which account to use. If you are not sure, ask before ordering — using the wrong account creates problems that are tedious to fix.

Log all purchases using lab funds on the Expense sheet. See Molly for the link. Note the funding source, supplier, items, and relevant details.

## Gateway

Most lab purchases go through [Gateway](https://gateway.procurement.ucsb.edu/), UCSB's online ordering system. The typical process:

1. Log in with your UCSB NetID.
2. Search for items. For major scientific suppliers (Fisher Scientific, VWR), Gateway redirects you to the supplier's website where you shop at UC-negotiated prices, then return to Gateway to finalize.
3. Build your cart. Add your project code after your name in the Cart Name field.
4. Finalize the cart and attach any required quotes or documents.
5. Assign the correct funding source and commodity/object codes.
6. Submit for approval. The requisition routes through departmental approval, then PI approval, then to procurement.

I approve all orders. Have a senior lab member train you on your first order. Gateway orders ship to the Bio Storeroom (Bldg. 569, Rm. 1101). Wait for Kurt's email confirmation before picking up.

**Common suppliers on Gateway:** Fisher Scientific, VWR, Amazon Business, Airgas (compressed gases), Dell, Apple, and Office Depot. For suppliers not in Gateway, you can create a non-catalog requisition by entering item details manually.

**Timing:** Routine orders under $10,000 typically take 3-7 business days from submission to delivery. Orders over $10,000, or those containing restricted items (chemicals, controlled substances), route to Central Purchasing and can take 1-2 additional weeks. Plan ahead if I am traveling — the approval queue stalls without PI action.

## When Gateway Is Not an Option

For suppliers that do not accept purchase orders, or for urgent purchases from non-catalog vendors, the lab FlexCard (purchasing card) may be used. The standard per-transaction limit is $10,000. Talk to Molly before using the FlexCard. It is the exception, not the default.

If you need to pay personally and seek reimbursement, do so only as a last resort. Reimbursement may be denied if the university determines a lower price was available through a contracted vendor. Always try Gateway or the FlexCard first.

## Equipment Purchases

Equipment costing $5,000 or more is classified as inventorial and has special procedures. It must be ordered through Gateway with the correct subaccount code, tagged by Equipment Management, and tracked in the university's inventory system. Purchases over $100,000 must be competitively bid. Talk to Molly or me before ordering any equipment.

## Chemical and Hazardous Materials

Chemicals and hazardous materials follow the standard Gateway process with additional routing. Flag restricted items in the "Additional Order Details" dropdown on the Requisition Summary tab so the order routes to EH&S for review. Allow extra processing time.

When you order a new chemical not already in the lab, print an SDS and add it to the Chemical Health and Safety Binder in Noble 2224. See the Required Trainings section for the full Chemical Health and Safety Plan.

## Reimbursements

- **MSI-administered grants:** Create a [Concur](https://www.concursolutions.com/) expense report (log in with your UCSB NetID) and add Melia Cutcher as an expense delegate.
- **EEMB-administered grants:** Fill out the reimbursement form and submit to Andi Jorgensen within 30 days with an itemized receipt.

Submit reimbursements promptly. Claims submitted more than 45 days after the expense may be reported as taxable income.

Do NOT place orders through third parties (non-UCSB personnel).
