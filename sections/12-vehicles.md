# Vehicles

## Lab Truck

Ford F-350. Any UCSB-affiliated staff or student can drive it. The lab is charged 70 cents per mile, so consolidate trips where possible. Two keys are stored in a secure, known location. Coordinate use via the lab truck Slack channel. Do NOT use diesel. Use unleaded gasoline only.

### Driver Authorization

All university vehicle use is governed by UC Business and Finance Bulletin BUS-46. Before driving any university vehicle (including the lab truck), you must:

- Hold a valid driver's license appropriate for the vehicle type.
- Complete the UC Driver Safety Training Program (online, through the UC Learning Center).
- Complete a Defensive Driving Course, which must be renewed every three years.
- Be enrolled in the DMV Employer Pull Notice (EPN) program, which allows the university to monitor your driving record.

Check with Molly Brzezinski or Adrian for the current process. If you do not have authorization, do not drive the truck. Drivers classified as negligent operators under the DMV's Negligent Operator Treatment System (NOTS) are prohibited from driving university vehicles.

### Scheduling and Usage Log

Coordinate all truck use through the lab truck Slack channel. If someone else has it reserved, work out timing or consolidate trips. After each use, update the Truck Usage Log on Google Drive with the date, driver, destination, mileage, and any issues. Keeping the log current helps us track costs and schedule maintenance.

### Parking

You can park in any spaces except handicapped, metered, coastal access, and orange restricted. Faculty, Service, and non-orange restricted spots are OK. Update the lab on the truck's location if you park outside Lot 1.

### Fueling

The UCSB campus fuel station is currently under construction. A purchase card sits in the center console of the truck for fueling at off-campus stations. The tank holds about 25 gallons. Do not let it fall below 1/4 tank.

### Upkeep

Keep the truck clean. Remove trash, personal gear, and field equipment after each trip. If the truck has been used at the coast or in saltwater environments, wash it when you return to campus -- salt corrodes the undercarriage and shortens the truck's life. The UCSB garage area has hose access. The truck should also be driven at least once a month to maintain the battery.

### Maintenance

Contact Molly Brzezinski (lab manager) for issues. If she is unavailable, contact Doug Hatt at the UCSB garage (805-893-3692). Before taking the truck on a long trip, check fluid levels, tire pressure, and general condition. Report any problems immediately -- do not leave them for the next person to discover. Update the Truck Maintenance Log on Google Drive after any service.

## University Vehicle Policies

A few additional rules apply to all university vehicles under BUS-46:

- **University business only.** University vehicles may not be used for personal errands, even brief ones. If you are driving to a field site and want to stop for groceries on the way back, use your own car for that leg.
- **Traffic violations are your responsibility.** Parking tickets, moving violations, and any fines incurred while driving a university vehicle are the personal responsibility of the driver, not the lab or the university.
- **Insurance.** University Auto Insurance covers liability and physical damage to university-owned vehicles. There is a $500 deductible per occurrence. If you are in an accident, report it to Risk Management immediately and notify Adrian.
- **Accidents.** Keep a copy of the university's accident reporting form in the truck's glove compartment. If you are in an accident, do not admit fault at the scene. Exchange information, document the scene with photos, and contact Risk Management and Adrian as soon as possible.

## UCSB Vehicle Rentals

Rentals are available for university business through TPS (805-893-2924). They offer sedans and larger vehicles, but these cannot be used for towing. Charges go to a university account.
