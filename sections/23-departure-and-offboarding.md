# Departure and Offboarding

## When to Start

Begin the offboarding process 2-3 months before your departure date. Some of these steps take time, and rushing them at the end leads to things falling through the cracks. Use the checklist below as a guide, and check items off with Adrian and Molly as you go.

## Offboarding Checklist

- **Archive your data.** Archive all datasets, code, and metadata on the lab NAS and/or Google Drive. Deposit published data in Dryad, Zenodo, or another appropriate repository. See the Data Management and Reproducible Science section for details on formats, metadata requirements, and the lab's data-after-departure policy.

- **Clean out your samples.** Remove or properly dispose of samples from freezers, the wet lab, and any shared spaces. If another student will continue processing them, coordinate the handoff directly and label everything clearly with the new point of contact.

- **Return keys and equipment.** Return all lab keys, equipment, and shared items. Notify Andi Jorgensen (amjorgen@ucsb.edu) about building access removal.

- **Update documentation.** If you maintained any protocols, equipment logs, or shared documents, make sure they are current. Confirm that another lab member knows where to find them.

- **Transfer institutional knowledge.** Spend time with the student(s) who will carry on related work. Walk them through your systems, your data, your code, and your equipment workarounds. This is one of the most valuable things you can do for the lab on your way out. The things in your head that feel obvious to you are not obvious to anyone else.

- **Return the truck keys.** If you had a set, make sure they are back in the designated location.

- **Clean your desk and lab bench.** Leave your workspace ready for the next person. Remove personal items, recycle old printouts, and wipe down surfaces.

- **Settle any outstanding purchases or reimbursements.** Submit final expense reports and clear any open purchase orders. Coordinate with Molly on any pending financial items.

## Manuscripts in Progress

If you have manuscripts in progress when you leave, discuss the timeline and plan with Adrian before your departure. Agree on:

- Who is responsible for what revisions and by when.
- Whether co-authors still in the lab will handle revisions during peer review.
- A realistic schedule for completion. Life after departure gets busy fast — the best time to finish a manuscript is before you leave.

The lab's general expectation is that you publish your own work within a couple of years of graduating. For the full policy on data and publications after departure, see the Data Management and Reproducible Science section.

## Exit Conversation

Before you leave, schedule a final meeting with Adrian to discuss:

- How the mentoring and advising relationship worked for you — what helped, what could have been better.
- Any feedback on the lab that might benefit current and future students.
- Your plans and how Adrian can support your next steps (letters of recommendation, introductions, ongoing collaborations).

This conversation is valuable in both directions. Honest feedback from departing lab members has shaped many of the policies in this manual.

## Update Your Contact Information

Keep your contact information current so Adrian can reach you for reference letters, questions about your data, and collaboration opportunities. Update your mailing address, personal email, and phone number before you go.

## Staying Connected

Leaving the lab does not mean leaving the community. Former lab members are always welcome at lab meetings, lab events, and Mo'orea field seasons if logistics allow. The door stays open.

I genuinely want to stay in touch, not just for references and collaborations, but because the relationships formed in this lab matter to me beyond the work itself. I have been lucky to watch people grow into incredible scientists. I care about where those paths lead.

Many former lab members continue to collaborate, co-author papers, and support current students long after they move on. By leaving the Stier Lab, you are not ending a chapter. You are joining a broader network that extends well beyond your time at UCSB. Some of the best ideas and partnerships I have been part of came from staying connected with former students and postdocs.

On the practical side: keep your contact info updated so I can reach you (and so I can send a reference letter to the right address). Stay on the lab Slack if you want. There is no expiration date on membership. And don't be a stranger. Send an email, share a paper, tell me about the cool thing you are working on. I want to hear about it.
