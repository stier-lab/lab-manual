# Technology

This section covers shared computing resources, network access, and tools you will use daily. If you run into technical issues, contact the Life Sciences Computing Group (LSCG) first. See the Valuable Contacts section for details.

## Lab Computer

The lab has a high-power iMac in Noble 2224 with 40 GB RAM. Ask Molly or me for the guest account password. If you need a private account, talk to me. Log out when done. Do not leave personal accounts open.

## Lab Server (Network Attached Storage / NAS)

The Stier Lab NAS is accessible at stier-nas1.eemb.ucsb.edu (on campus or via VPN).

- **Mac:** `smb://stier-nas1.eemb.ucsb.edu`
- **Windows:** `\\stier-nas1.eemb.ucsb.edu`

Authentication uses Active Directory Service (ADS) accounts (ADS\username). Contact the Life Sciences Computing Group for connection help: help@lscg.ucsb.edu (general) or help@lifesci.ucsb.edu (EEMB-specific IT support).

## Internet Access

Connect to LifeSci[BuildingName] for computers and LifeSciGadget for phones. New devices require an LSCG appointment. Email help@lifesci.ucsb.edu (EEMB IT) or visit [lscg.ucsb.edu](https://www.lscg.ucsb.edu/) to submit a request. WiFi can be spotty in Noble, so many people use ethernet. Use your ADS username (usually your last name), not your UCNetID.

## Personal Computers

You will need your own laptop for research, writing, and analysis. If this is a financial hardship, talk to me — there may be options through the department or Graduate Division. The shared lab iMac in Noble 2224 is available for heavy computing tasks, but it is not a substitute for having your own machine.

If your laptop dies or needs repair, the Life Sciences Computing Group has loaner machines. The Graduate Division may also have a loaner program. Do not let a broken computer silently stall your progress for weeks.

## Backing Up Your Computer

Back up your work regularly -- ideally daily. Hard drives fail, laptops get stolen, and coffee gets spilled. Do not keep the only copy of your dissertation on a single device.

- **UCSB Box** provides unlimited cloud storage and is the easiest first line of backup.
- **External hard drives** provide a local backup in case you lose internet access.
- **The lab NAS** is backed up regularly and is a good place to store research data (see Data Management section).
- Use at least two of these. If your work exists in only one location, it is not backed up.

## Printing

The printer is on the 2nd floor of Noble next to my office. You must be connected to LifeSci Noble. For poster printing, ITST and CNSI charge $40 for a standard 48x36 poster.

## VPN Connection

For off-campus access to UCSB resources, set up the Ivanti Secure Access VPN. This requires Duo multi-factor authentication enrollment. Find setup instructions at [UCSB IT](https://www.it.ucsb.edu/network-infrastructure-services/ivanti-connect-secure-campus-vpn).
