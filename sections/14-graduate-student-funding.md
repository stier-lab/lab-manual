# Graduate Student Funding

Funding is one of the most important (and sometimes most stressful) parts of graduate school. Adrian's goal is that you never worry about whether you can afford to stay in the program. This section explains how funding works so you can plan ahead and take advantage of the opportunities available.

## Stipend & Support

EEMB faculty aim to fully support their students in good standing for the duration of their studies. Support comes from a combination of Teaching Assistantships, Graduate Student Researcher positions, and fellowships. Unlike some UCSB departments, EEMB does not offer a formal multi-year guaranteed funding package. Funding depends on the admitting faculty member's grants and resources. The department has limited funds and tries to support students through their first year. After that, Adrian works with each student to piece together support from TA lines, grants, and fellowships.

In practice, your support will come from a combination of:

- **Teaching Assistantships (TA):** All EEMB students are required to TA at least 2 quarters. Each faculty member can count on TA support for one student per year (3 quarters of total support). TA appointments at 25%+ provide partial fee remission (tuition, student service fee, campus-based fees, and UC Student Health Insurance Plan [UC-SHIP]). Standard appointments are 50% time.

- **Graduate Student Researcher (GSR):** Funded through Adrian's grants. GSR appointments at 35%+ provide full fee remission, including non-resident supplemental tuition (NRST). At 25-34%, only partial fee remission applies (no NRST coverage).

- **Fellowships:** Campus and external fellowships supplement TA/GSR support.

Discuss your funding picture with Adrian and the Graduate Advisor (Mengshu Ye) at the start of each academic year.

## Summer Funding

Summer support is not automatic, so plan ahead. The department's block grant funds can provide summer stipends, but these are competitive. You must apply with a statement of need and a faculty nomination. Other sources include GSR positions (if Adrian has summer grant funding), summer TAships (limited, separate application), and external fellowships (e.g., NSF GRFP provides 12-month support including summer). It is wise to budget based on your 9-month salary and treat summer funding as a welcome supplement. Talk to Adrian early each spring about summer plans.

## Fee Remission & NRST

Understanding fee remission is important, especially for international and out-of-state students:

- **TA (25%+):** Partial fee remission covers tuition, student service fee, campus fees, and UC-SHIP. Does NOT cover NRST.
- **GSR (35%+):** Full fee remission covers everything above PLUS NRST.
- **International students:** The International Doctoral Recruitment Fellowship (IDRF) automatically covers NRST from your 4th quarter through advancement to candidacy. After advancing, NRST is waived for 3 years (9 quarters). Your first year's NRST (~$15,000) must come from other sources (GSR at 35%+, departmental fellowship, or similar).

## Fellowships

Apply for external fellowships, especially the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP). Note: as of the FY2026 solicitation, only first-year graduate students are eligible to apply (second-year students are no longer eligible). This means you should begin preparing your application before you arrive or very early in your first year. The application takes several months of serious writing and revision. Start early, get feedback from labmates and Adrian, and plan multiple drafts. Fellowship funding benefits you directly (often higher stipend, more independence) and frees up lab resources for other students.

Other fellowships to consider:
- **External:** Ford Foundation Fellowship, Fulbright, NDSEG, Nancy Foster Scholarship (NOAA)
- **UCSB campus (department-nominated):** Chancellor's Fellowship, Regents Fellowship, Eugene Cota-Robles Fellowship
- **EEMB-specific:** Charles A. Storke Award ($2,500), Ellen Schamberg Burley Award (travel)
- **Graduate Division:** Dissertation Fellowship, Broida-Hirschfelder Fellowship ($5,000-$10,500)

New applicants are automatically considered for campus fellowship competitions. The department strongly encourages extramural pre-doctoral fellowship applications.

## Research Expenses and Writing Your Own Grants

Part of becoming an independent scientist is learning to fund your own research. Adrian will help you identify funding sources. He will support your work through his grants when your project aligns with them. But you should also write and submit small grants throughout your program. Design projects that are financially feasible. Talk to Adrian before purchasing anything from his accounts. Always know the correct funding source/speed type for any purchase. See the Purchasing, Shipping, and Reimbursement section for logistics.

### Why Write Grants as a Student?

Grant writing is a skill you will use for the rest of your scientific career. Starting early — even with small proposals — builds the muscle. Each proposal you write forces you to clarify your thinking, articulate significance, and plan a realistic budget and timeline. Funded grants also look good on your CV, demonstrate independence to future employers, and free up lab resources for other students.

### Where to Apply

Start small and build up. Opportunities include:

- **UCSB sources:** Graduate Division Dissertation Fellowship, Block Grant summer funding, departmental awards
- **UC system:** UC Natural Reserve System Mathias Grants (relevant if you work at a UC reserve, including Gump Station)
- **Scientific societies:** Sigma Xi Grants-in-Aid of Research, Ecology and Evolution of Communities grants from disciplinary societies (ESA, SICB, etc.)
- **Federal pre-doctoral fellowships:** NSF GRFP (see the Fellowships section above), NDSEG, Ford Foundation
- **Conservation and marine-specific:** Nancy Foster Scholarship (NOAA), Explorer's Club grants, National Geographic Early Career Grant, Myers Oceanographic Trust

The Consolidated Funding List in the shared Google Drive folder tracks opportunities and deadlines. Check it at the start of each quarter.

### The Process

1. **Identify the opportunity** well before the deadline. Most proposals take 4-8 weeks of serious work. Major fellowships like NSF GRFP take several months.
2. **Read the solicitation carefully.** Understand what the funder values, what the review criteria are, and what they are not funding. Tailor your proposal to the specific program.
3. **Draft a rough outline** and discuss it with Adrian before writing. This is where most proposals go wrong — not in the writing, but in the framing and feasibility.
4. **Write the full draft.** Budget enough time for multiple revisions. A first draft is never the final draft.
5. **Get feedback.** Share with Adrian and at least one labmate. If possible, share with someone who has successfully applied to the same program.
6. **Revise and submit.** Leave time for the administrative side — institutional approvals, budget forms, and biosketches. UCSB's Office of Research requires lead time for proposals that go through the university.

Adrian will review grant drafts and provide feedback. For larger proposals, expect multiple rounds of revision. For small grants, one round may be sufficient. Either way, do not wait until the last week to ask for feedback.

## Conferences

You are responsible for conference costs. Available travel support:

- **Ellen Schamberg Burley Award** (EEMB): For advanced doctoral candidates presenting at scientific meetings
- **Academic Senate Doctoral Student Travel Grant:** $250 (virtual), $900 (domestic), $1,500 (international). You must be advanced to candidacy.
- **GSA Conference Travel Grant:** Up to $200 reimbursement, for students NOT yet advanced to candidacy
- **Adrian's grants:** If your presentation is related to an active grant, he may be able to help
- Some conferences offer registration fee waivers for student volunteers

See the Travel section for booking procedures, travel advances, and reimbursement logistics.

## Your Union: UAW Local 4811

As a graduate student employee at UCSB (whether you hold a TA or GSR appointment), you are a member of **UAW Local 4811** (United Auto Workers). This is the union that represents over 48,000 academic workers across all 10 UC campuses. Dues are automatically deducted from your paycheck.

UAW 4811 was formed through a 2024 merger of three earlier unions: UAW Local 2865 (Teaching Assistants, Readers, and Tutors), Student Researchers United / SRU-UAW (Graduate Student Researchers), and UAW Local 5810 (Postdocs and Academic Researchers). The merger brought all academic workers under one bargaining unit.

**The 2022 strike.** In November 2022, about 48,000 UC academic workers walked off the job in what became the largest higher education strike in U.S. history. The strike lasted roughly six weeks and produced major gains. Minimum salaries for graduate employees increased by about 46%. Parental leave expanded to 8 weeks of fully paid leave. Childcare reimbursements were established. New workplace protections against abusive conduct were written into the contract.

**Where things stand now.** The 2022 contracts were extended through late 2025, and new negotiations are ongoing. Labor relations at the UC are an evolving situation that will continue to change throughout your time here. I encourage you to stay informed about your contract and your rights, regardless of your personal feelings about unions. Understanding your contract helps you understand your pay, your workload limits (a 50% appointment means a maximum of 20 hours per week), your grievance rights, and the protections available to you.

**Your rights.** If you believe your contract rights have been violated -- workload exceeding your appointment percentage, pay issues, unsafe working conditions, or anything else covered by the contract -- you have the right to file a formal grievance through UAW Local 4811. Contact your campus steward for guidance. Retaliation for exercising your contract rights or participating in union activity (attending meetings, bargaining, informational actions) is prohibited under California labor law and the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act.

**Parental leave and caregiving.** The 2022 contract established 8 weeks of fully paid parental leave for graduate student employees and childcare reimbursements. If you are a parent or caregiver, these provisions apply to you. Contact your steward or the UAW 4811 website for current details, as specific provisions may change with new contracts. If caregiving responsibilities affect your schedule, talk to me -- we will work out flexible arrangements. Being a parent or caregiver will not be held against you in evaluations, opportunities, or recommendations. UCSB also offers childcare through the [Orfalea Family Children's Center](https://childrenscenter.sa.ucsb.edu/) and maintains lactation rooms across campus.
