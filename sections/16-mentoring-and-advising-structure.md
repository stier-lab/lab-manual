# Mentoring and Advising Structure

The lab uses several structured tools for transparent, consistent mentoring:

- **Mentor/Mentee Agreement:** You and Adrian complete this at the start of your program. It covers goals, expectations, communication preferences, work style, and how to handle problems. You revisit it annually.

- **Lab Working Agreement:** The whole lab reviews and signs this yearly. It spells out shared values around communication, process, and collaboration.

- **Individual Development Plans (IDPs):** Annual review with quarterly check-ins. Covers research milestones, skills development, and career planning.

- **Annual meetings with Graduate Advisor:** All students meet with the Graduate Advisor (currently Mengshu Ye) yearly (for at least the first two years) to provide feedback on mentorship. Adrian also meets with the Graduate Advisor to address any concerns.

## What Adrian Commits To

- Timely feedback on written work within agreed-upon timelines.
- Quarterly milestone tracking aligned with your IDP.
- Documented meeting summaries shared after each advising meeting.
- Written role descriptions for GSR/TA responsibilities each quarter, including clear separation of paid vs. voluntary tasks.
- A written description of how student accomplishments support recommendation letters, provided at the start of the advising relationship.
- Monthly updates to the Department Chair and Graduate Advisor (Mengshu Ye) on lab climate and student progress.

## What Students Commit To

- Active participation in IDP development and quarterly reviews.
- Proactive communication about problems, delays, or concerns. Speak up early rather than late.
- Engaging constructively with feedback, even when it is uncomfortable.
- Contributing to lab community: attending lab meetings, helping maintain shared spaces, supporting labmates.
