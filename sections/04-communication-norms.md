# Communication Norms

Clear communication sounds obvious but is genuinely hard to get right. This is especially true in a lab where people have different schedules, are sometimes in Mo'orea, and are juggling coursework, teaching, and research. Here is how I prefer we handle it.

## The Basics

- Check email at least once per business day. Respond to things that need a response within one business day. You do not need to have the answer. Just acknowledge you saw it.

- If you will be away from email for more than a day (fieldwork, travel, vacation), let me and relevant labmates know in advance.

- Do not disappear without notice. If you need time away, that is completely fine. But tell someone first.

## How I Use Different Channels

**Slack** is my primary communication tool and the fastest way to reach me. Our workspace is at stierlab.slack.com. I check Slack throughout the day. It is the best channel for anything that needs a timely response: questions, coordination, sharing updates, day-to-day logistics. Use the "Do Not Disturb" settings to protect your evenings. I encourage this.

**Email** is fine for longer-form communication, especially with external collaborators or for things that need a paper trail. But emails can get lost in my inbox. If something is time-sensitive or you have not heard back in a day or two, follow up on Slack. I will sometimes send emails at odd hours (evenings, weekends, early mornings). This does not mean I expect a response outside of business hours. I write when something is on my mind so I do not forget, not because I need you to act on it at 10 PM.

Oh, and I like salutations. A "Hi Adrian" at the top of an email goes a long way. It is a small thing, but emails that jump straight into a request read as curt to me, even when I know they are not intended that way.

**Text or phone:** Reserve these for genuinely time-sensitive or urgent matters. If it is a real emergency, call rather than text. I mean things like safety issues in the field, a freezer failure, or something that cannot wait until the next business day.

**In person** is best for anything that will turn into a long email thread. If you find yourself drafting a third reply in the same chain and it is getting complicated, just come knock on my door or schedule a meeting. I almost always prefer a 15-minute conversation over a week of back-and-forth emails.

## A Note on Timing

I encourage communication during roughly standard business hours (8 AM--5 PM). If you are writing after hours, consider using scheduled-send so it arrives in the morning. This is not a rigid rule. Field schedules and time zones sometimes make off-hours communication necessary. But as a default, let's respect each other's non-work time.

## Vacation and Time Away

Take vacation. You need it, and you will do better work because of it. Graduate school is a marathon, not a sprint, and people who never step away from their work tend to burn out or produce diminishing returns.

There is no fixed number of vacation days for graduate students. As a general guideline, two to three weeks per year (outside of field seasons and major deadlines) is reasonable. Some of this may overlap with university holidays and the break between quarters. Use your judgment.

When you plan time away:

- Let Adrian and relevant labmates know at least a week in advance for short breaks (a few days), and further ahead for longer trips (a week or more).
- Add your time away to the Stier Lab Availability calendar so the lab can plan around it.
- If you have ongoing responsibilities (samples being processed, TA duties, undergraduate mentees), arrange coverage or communicate the gap before you leave.
- If you are going somewhere without reliable internet or phone service (Mo'orea, backcountry, etc.), make sure someone knows your plan and expected return.

This also applies to sick days: if you are unwell, stay home and let the relevant people know. You do not need to justify it beyond a quick message.
