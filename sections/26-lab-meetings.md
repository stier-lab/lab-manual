# Lab Meetings

## Overview

We hold lab meetings weekly during the academic year. They typically run about an hour to ninety minutes. During the summer, we pause. Most of the lab is in Mo'orea or otherwise deep in fieldwork, and the rhythm of the quarter does not apply. When we are back on campus in the fall, lab meetings pick up again.

Lab meeting is the one time each week when the whole group is in the same room thinking together. I consider it one of the most important things we do.

## Format

We use a rotating sign-up system. At the start of each quarter, everyone claims one or two weeks. The person who signs up for a given week sets the agenda and leads the meeting. You decide what you need from the group that day. It is your time to use well.

Some common formats:

- **Project workshopping.** Walk us through a study design, a confusing result, or an analysis you are stuck on. Bring the messy version. We will help you think through it.
- **Manuscript or proposal feedback.** Circulate a draft (or a section of one) at least a few days in advance so people can read it carefully. Use the meeting to discuss framing, logic, and structure rather than line edits.
- **Practice talks.** Before a conference, defense, or job talk, use lab meeting for a full run-through. We will give you honest feedback on content, pacing, and clarity.
- **Paper discussion.** Pick a paper, book chapter, or essay that is shaping your thinking. It does not have to be in our subfield. Some of the best discussions come from work that challenges how we see our own questions.
- **Brainstorming sessions.** Got a half-formed idea for a new project or collaboration? Bring it. The group is good at pressure-testing ideas and finding angles you have not considered.
- **Visitors.** When a job candidate or seminar speaker visits, we sometimes use lab meeting for an informal conversation with them.

- **Lab values check-in.** Periodically, we use lab meeting to check in on how we are doing as a group. Are people feeling supported? Is the workload distribution fair? Is anything brewing that we should address? These conversations are not about airing grievances. They are about maintaining the culture we want before small problems become big ones.

There is no single "right" way to lead a lab meeting. Some people use slides. Some draw on the whiteboard. Some just talk. The only requirement is that you come prepared and give the rest of us enough context to be useful.

## Attendance

Lab meeting attendance is expected for all graduate students and postdocs. If you have a genuine conflict (a TA section, a medical appointment, fieldwork), that is fine. Just let us know. But treat it as a real commitment, not an optional event.

Undergraduates are welcome and encouraged to attend, even if you are just observing. You will learn a lot about how scientific thinking works by watching people wrestle with ideas in real time.

## On Vulnerability

I want to be direct about something. Leading a lab meeting can feel intimidating. You are standing in front of people you respect, presenting work that is not finished, asking for help with something you have not figured out yet. That can trigger real insecurity, especially early in your career.

That feeling is normal, and it is a sign you are doing it right. The best lab meetings happen when someone is honest about where they are, where the gaps are, what is confusing, and what is not working. If you only ever present polished, finished work, you have missed the point.

Our job as a lab is to make that vulnerability productive. We ask questions to understand, not to perform. We challenge ideas because we want the work to be stronger, not because we want to look smart. And we remember that the "stupid question" someone is afraid to ask is often the one that cracks the problem open.

## Departmental Seminars

Beyond our own lab meetings, EEMB departmental seminars are an important part of intellectual life at UCSB. I encourage everyone to attend when your schedule permits. The talks expose you to ideas and systems well outside your own work. That breadth matters. Some of the most interesting questions in ecology emerge at the boundaries between subfields. When you do attend a seminar, talk about it with labmates afterward. Even a quick conversation over coffee can sharpen your thinking about your own research.
