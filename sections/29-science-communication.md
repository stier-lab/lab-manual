# Science Communication and Public Engagement

## Why It Matters

We study ecosystems that people care about — coral reefs, marine communities, the ocean. The public funds our work and is affected by what we discover. Communicating our science beyond academic journals is not optional or extracurricular. It is part of the job.

That said, communicating well to non-specialist audiences is a skill, and like any skill it requires practice and thought. This section covers expectations and some practical guidance.

## Representing the Lab

When you give a public talk, post on social media about your research, talk to a journalist, or write for a general audience, you are representing yourself, the lab, UCSB, and the scientific community. This is not meant to make you anxious. It is meant to make you thoughtful.

A few principles:

- **Be accurate.** Do not overstate your findings. Resist the temptation to make results sound more dramatic or certain than they are. Uncertainty is part of science, and the public respects honesty more than hype.
- **Stay in your lane.** Speak with authority about your own work and your area of expertise. When asked about topics outside your expertise, say so. "That is not my area, but here is someone who would know" is a perfectly good answer.
- **Credit your collaborators.** Science is collaborative. When discussing work publicly, acknowledge the team.
- **Distinguish your views from the lab's.** If you are expressing a personal opinion (about policy, management, or anything controversial), make clear that you are speaking for yourself and not for the lab or UCSB.

## Social Media

Social media is a powerful tool for sharing your work, building your professional network, and engaging with the public and other scientists. Many ecology careers have benefited from a thoughtful social media presence. I encourage you to use it if it fits your style.

Some guidance:

- **Share your science.** Post about your publications, fieldwork, conference talks, and scientific interests. Photos and short videos from the field do well and help people connect with what we do.
- **Engage constructively.** Academic social media can be contentious. You do not need to participate in every debate. When you do engage, be professional and assume good faith.
- **Think before posting.** The internet is permanent. A quick reaction to a controversy can follow you for years. If you are unsure about something, sleep on it or ask a labmate.
- **Protect unpublished work.** Sharing fieldwork photos and general project updates is fine. Sharing unpublished results, figures, or data is not — unless you and your co-authors have agreed to it.

## Talking to Journalists and Media

If a reporter contacts you about your work, great. A few things to know:

- **You can say yes.** You do not need my permission or UCSB's to talk to a reporter, though giving me a heads-up is appreciated.
- **You can ask for questions in advance.** Most reporters will share their questions or topic beforehand if you ask.
- **You can review quotes.** It is reasonable to ask to see your quotes before publication. Not all reporters will agree, but many will.
- **UCSB Public Affairs** can help. If a media request feels big or sensitive, the UCSB Office of Public Affairs and Communication can provide media training and help you prepare. They are at [news.ucsb.edu](https://news.ucsb.edu/).
- **Talk to me** if a media inquiry involves anything politically sensitive, controversial, or related to a grant funder. Not because you need permission, but because it helps to think through framing together.

## Outreach and Broader Impacts

Many grants (especially NSF) require broader impacts activities. More importantly, outreach connects our work to the communities affected by it. Opportunities include:

- UCSB's Research Experience and Education Facility (REEF) and the campus aquarium
- Local school visits and classroom presentations
- Science nights and community events in Santa Barbara
- Outreach tied to fieldwork in Mo'orea (working with local schools and communities)
- Writing for general-audience outlets (blogs, The Conversation, popular science magazines)

If outreach is important to you, include it in your IDP and we will make space for it. It counts as real, valuable work in this lab.
