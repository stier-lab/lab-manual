# Gender Equity and Lab Climate

## Our Commitment

Science benefits from diverse perspectives, and a healthy lab climate is everyone's responsibility. The Stier Lab is committed to creating an environment where all members can do their best work and feel valued. This applies regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, socioeconomic background, or career stage.

## What We Do

- **Annual task and opportunity audit:** I regularly review task distribution, authorship opportunities, conference invitations, and mentoring loads across the lab to check for patterns of inequity. If imbalances are found, they are discussed openly and corrected.

- **Annual anonymous climate survey:** Each year, the lab conducts an anonymous survey to gauge lab climate, workload clarity, sense of belonging, and whether all lab members feel supported. Results are shared with the lab (in aggregate) and used to guide concrete changes.

- **Equitable speaking time:** In lab meetings and group discussions, we actively work to give everyone space to contribute. If you notice that certain voices consistently dominate or are overlooked, say something. Raise it with the person, with me, or in the anonymous survey.

- **Inclusive mentoring:** Graduate students mentoring undergraduates should be mindful of the added barriers that first-generation, low-income, and underrepresented students face. The lab is committed to providing equitable access to research opportunities regardless of a student's ability to volunteer unpaid time.

## Raising Concerns

If you notice inequitable patterns in task assignments, speaking time, credit for ideas, access to resources, or anything else, raise it. You can do so:

- Directly with me
- Through the annual anonymous survey
- Through the Graduate Advisor (Mengshu Ye) or Faculty Graduate Advisor (Hillary Young)
- Through UCSB's Office of Equal Opportunity & Discrimination Prevention

You should never feel that raising an equity concern will affect your standing in the lab. See the Safety section for formal reporting channels and confidential resources.
