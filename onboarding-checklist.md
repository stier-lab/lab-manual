# Welcome to the Stier Lab and UCSB!

We are excited to welcome you to our community. We want your transition into the research group to go smoothly. This checklist and the activities below will help you get started in your first quarter. Ask Adrian any questions you have!

---

## Web Services & Accounts

### Slack (Primary Communication)

Slack is Adrian's primary communication tool and the fastest way to reach him. The lab uses it for day-to-day communication, quick questions, coordination, and sharing updates. It is available as a web platform, desktop app, and phone app.

- Download at [slack.com](https://www.slack.com)
- Request access to the Stier Lab workspace: **stierlab.slack.com**
- Create or join topic-specific channels for projects you're involved with

### Email & Google Calendar

Email works well for longer-form communication and anything that needs a paper trail. Be aware that emails can get lost in Adrian's inbox. If something is time-sensitive and you have not heard back, follow up on Slack.

Once you have your UCSB email and Connect account:

- We'll add you to the **Stier Lab Google Group** (stierlab@googlegroups.com) for lab-wide emails
- We'll share the **Stier Lab calendar** (departmental events, conferences, holidays) and the **Stier Lab Availability calendar** (personal schedules for coordinating meetings)
- Populate the calendar with your vacation dates, seminars, meetings, or anything else the lab should know about

### Google Drive

Our shared repository for lab materials.

- Log in with your @ucsb.edu account and request an invitation to the Stier Lab shared folder
- **Note:** UCSB Google Drive storage is limited to 150 GB per account (shared across Gmail, Drive, and Photos). For large datasets, use the lab NAS or UCSB Box (unlimited storage) instead
- The desktop app for Google Drive is often easier to work with than the web interface

### UCSB Box

UCSB provides unlimited Box cloud storage. This is your best option for large file backup alongside the lab NAS.

### Zotero

Our preferred citation manager.

- Create an account at [zotero.org](https://www.zotero.org/)
- Send your username to Adrian or a labmate, and we'll invite you to the lab's shared citation groups
- You can also create personal libraries and share them with collaborators

### VPN (Ivanti Secure Access)

For off-campus access to UCSB library resources, the lab NAS, and other campus services. Requires Duo multi-factor authentication.

- Setup instructions at [it.ucsb.edu/ivanti-secure-access-campus-vpn](https://www.it.ucsb.edu/network-infrastructure-services/ivanti-connect-secure-campus-vpn)

## Files to Review

Once you're connected to the Stier Lab shared folder, familiarize yourself with the following files and folders (these are linked directly in the shared Google Drive folder):

- **Academic Advice folder:** Tips and resources for various stages of your academic career
- **Admin folder:** Important forms and administrative information
- **Consolidated Funding List** (in Funding folder): Fellowships and funding opportunities with deadlines
- **Resources folder:** Helpful documents on a range of topics, plus materials for creating figures and presentations
- **Stier Lab Inventory:** Current lab inventory, useful for identifying available equipment
- **Stier Lab Working Agreement:** General principles for interpersonal interaction and workplace culture. Reviewed and updated at the first lab meeting of each academic year
- **Stier Lab Manual:** This document. Logistics, information, and policies for UCSB and the lab
- **Stier Lab SCUBA Manual:** Guidelines and resources for local fieldwork and diving at UCSB

---

## Keys and Building Access

- **Noble Hall, Bio2 keys:** Pick up from Kurt Bellefeuille in the Bio Storeroom (Bldg 569, Rm 1101). Andi Jorgensen or Adrian can submit the key request form on the UCSB website on your behalf. Allow at least 24 hours before pickup.
- **Digital access (ID card):** Email Andi Jorgensen (amjorgen@ucsb.edu) with your UCSB ID number and which buildings you need access to (MSRB, LSB, Bio 2).
- **The Point / boatyard / aquarium:** Coordinate with Christoph Pierre (pierre@lifesci.ucsb.edu) for keys and access codes.

See the Facilities section of the Lab Manual for the full key list.

---

## WiFi and Network

- Connect to **LifeSci[BuildingName]** for computers and **LifeSciGadget** for phones
- You'll need a Life Sciences Computing Group (LSCG) appointment for new devices. Visit [lscg.ucsb.edu/help](https://www.lscg.ucsb.edu/) or email help@lscg.ucsb.edu to submit a request
- Request connection to both WiFi and Ethernet in your office. Ethernet helps a lot with upload speed for video calls
- If your computer doesn't have an Ethernet port, purchase a USB-to-Ethernet adapter before your LSCG appointment
- Your LSCG/ADS username is typically your last name (not your UCNetID)

---

## Required Trainings

Complete these as soon as possible. See the Required Trainings section of the Lab Manual for full details:

- [ ] UC Learning Center account setup (learningcenter.ucsb.edu)
- [ ] Cyber Security Awareness Training
- [ ] Fundamentals of Laboratory Safety
- [ ] UC Preventing Harassment & Discrimination
- [ ] Gateway 101 (if you will be ordering supplies)
- [ ] LHAT Group training (have Adrian add you to the Stier Lab LHAT Group)
- [ ] IACUC training (if your research involves animals, start early because this takes time)

## UCSB ID Card

Get your ID at the information desk at the University Center. Have your Perm number ready. Check with EEMB about the $30 reimbursement.

---

## Individual Development Plan (IDP)

All lab members complete and review an IDP each year. The IDP sets milestones, tracks progress, and gives structure to conversations about your professional development with Adrian.

### Getting Started

Begin with a self-assessment. Complete the assessments at:

- **myIDP** (AAAS): [myidp.sciencecareers.org](https://myidp.sciencecareers.org/) (Skills, Interests, and Values assessments)
- **University of Wisconsin IDP guide**: [grad.wisc.edu/professional-development/individual-development-plan](https://grad.wisc.edu/professional-development/individual-development-plan/)
- **Rutgers IDP guide**: [grad.rutgers.edu/academics/individual-development-plans](https://grad.rutgers.edu/academics/individual-development-plans)

Save your results for future comparison.

### Self-Assessment Questions

Use the information from these assessments to reflect on the following. These are starting points for your IDP conversations with Adrian, not a to-do list. Your answers will change as your circumstances evolve.

**Strengths and growth areas:**
- What are your biggest strengths coming into this position? (List at least 3)
- In which areas do you most want to improve during your time in the lab? (List at least 3)

**Past accomplishments** (if applicable):
- What are the biggest improvements you've made or skills you've learned in the past year?
- How did your progress compare to what you had planned?
- What goals did you not make adequate progress on, and what steps can you take this year?
- List your tangible outcomes from the previous year (publications, presentations, certifications, etc.)

**Present goals:**
- What skills, techniques, or approaches do you most need to succeed in your current position? Do you already have them, or do you need to develop them?
- What steps can you take on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis to maintain good habits and make progress toward your goals?

**Future goals:**
- What is your "next step" career goal? What skills will be most important, and do you already have them?
- What is your longer-term career goal? How do the skills differ from those needed for your next step?

### Goal-Setting

Here is a tool for short and long-term goal-setting: [myIDP Career Advancement Goals](https://myidp.sciencecareers.org/CareerAdvancementGoals/QuickTips)

Use the SMART framework when setting goals:

| | |
|---|---|
| **S -- Specific** | Is it focused and unambiguous? |
| **M -- Measurable** | Can someone determine whether you achieved it? |
| **A -- Action-oriented** | Did you specify the action you will take? |
| **R -- Realistic** | Considering difficulty and timeframe, is it attainable? |
| **T -- Time-bound** | Did you specify a deadline? |

Track your goals using a simple table:

| Category | Specific Goal | Timeline | Intended Outcome | Achieved? |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Research | | | | |
| Writing | | | | |
| Teaching | | | | |
| Professional Development | | | | |
