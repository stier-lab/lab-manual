# Mo'orea Fieldwork

## Overview

Much of the Stier Lab's research takes place on the island of Mo'orea in French Polynesia. Field seasons are a defining part of the graduate experience in this lab. This is where your ideas meet the reef, and where some of the most formative learning happens. Field seasons are also logistically complex, physically demanding, and culturally rich. This section covers what you need to know.

## The Gump Station

We are based at the UC Berkeley Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station, located on Cook's Bay, Mo'orea. The station provides:

- **Housing:** On-station housing is available for researchers. Coordinate with Adrian and the station manager well in advance, as space fills up during peak season.
- **Lab space:** Wet and dry lab facilities are available at the station. Discuss your specific needs with Adrian before arriving so space and equipment can be arranged.
- **Meals:** Meals are self-cooked. There is a shared kitchen at the station, and grocery stores are accessible on the island. Budget and plan accordingly.

## Timing and Duration

A typical field season runs about 3 months during the summer, often starting in May. Not every student goes every year. Timing depends on your research stage and project needs. Discuss field season plans with Adrian well before the start of the calendar year so that travel, permits, and funding can be arranged.

## Travel and Funding

Mo'orea trips are typically funded through Adrian's grants. Book all travel through Connexxus (UCSB's travel booking portal). For international travel, you must also register at [UC Away](https://www.ucop.edu/risk-services-travel/registering.html) for UC travel insurance coverage.

Start the booking and paperwork process early. International travel through university systems takes longer than you expect.

## Research Permits

Research in French Polynesia requires permits. These are one of the least exciting but most critical parts of international fieldwork. You cannot conduct research without them. Failing to obtain proper permits puts the lab's long-term access to the site at risk.

- **Protocole d'accueil:** You need a research permit (Protocole d'accueil) to travel to Mo'orea and conduct research at the Gump Station. The Gump Station staff can help with this process, but you need to plan well ahead. Applications can take weeks to months.
- **CITES permits:** If your research involves returning coral samples (or other CITES-listed organisms) to the United States, you will need a CITES export permit from French Polynesia and a CITES import permit from the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Start this process at least 4 months before departure. It is one of the most time-consuming pieces of international fieldwork logistics.
- **Declaration APA:** All biodiversity sampling requires filing a declaration with DIREN (Direction de l'Environnement) under the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing. This is mandatory.
- **Fisheries permits:** Collection of marine animals, especially using SCUBA, requires permits from the French Polynesian fisheries department.
- **Housing reservations:** Book housing at the Gump Station through the UC Natural Reserve System (UCNRS) reservation system at [RAMS](https://rams.ucnrs.org/). Submit your application at least 2 months before your first visit to allow time for immigration paperwork.
- **General advice:** Start the permit process as early as possible and keep Adrian informed of your progress. Build in extra time for delays, especially if this is your first trip.

## Equipment and Shipping

- **Large equipment** is typically shipped to the station in advance. Work with Adrian and Molly Brzezinski (lab manager) on shipping logistics, customs requirements, and timing.
- **Smaller gear and personal equipment** is often brought in duffel bags. Pack thoughtfully. Replacement parts and specialty items are not easy to find on the island.
- We maintain shared equipment at the Gump Station, including field supplies (transect tapes, zip-locks, vials), lab equipment (balances, microscopes), and dive gear. These are available to all lab members working in Mo'orea. Replace items as they are used, lost, or destroyed. Please help maintain a current inventory.
- Make an equipment list and review it with Adrian and experienced lab members before your first trip.

## Being a Guest in Mo'orea

Mo'orea is not just a field site. It is home to a Polynesian community with a deep cultural history, including a colonial history that shapes daily life. As visiting researchers, you are guests. Keep this in mind:

- **Learn some French and Tahitian.** French is the administrative language and what you will use in stores, restaurants, and with many community members. Even basic Tahitian greetings and phrases go a long way toward building goodwill and showing respect. Make the effort.
- **Be respectful of local customs, spaces, and relationships.** You are representing UCSB, the Gump Station, and this lab. How you conduct yourself affects the community's willingness to host future researchers.
- **Engage genuinely.** The relationships between the station and the local community matter enormously. Be a thoughtful neighbor, not just a visiting scientist.

## Health Preparations

Visit a travel medicine clinic at least 4-6 weeks before departure. Mo'orea has no malaria, but there are other health considerations.

**Recommended vaccinations (confirm with your travel clinic):**
- Hepatitis A and B
- Typhoid (especially if eating outside tourist establishments)
- Routine vaccines up to date (Tdap, MMR, COVID-19)
- Rabies pre-exposure vaccination (consider if doing extensive outdoor/animal work)

**Medications to carry:**
- Ciprofloxacin or azithromycin for traveler's diarrhea (get a prescription from your travel clinic)
- Topical antibiotic ointment (bacitracin or mupirocin) for coral cuts — these are your most common injury
- Oral antibiotics (e.g., cephalexin) for wound infections, since coral cuts embed calcareous fragments and marine bacteria that make tropical wound infections aggressive
- Hydrocortisone cream for stings and rashes
- DEET-based insect repellent (20%+ concentration) — dengue is mosquito-borne and outbreaks occur in French Polynesia
- Reef-safe sunscreen (SPF 50+). The UV index in Mo'orea is extreme (10-12+). You will burn in under 15 minutes without protection
- Any personal prescriptions in original labeled packaging

**Insurance:**
- Confirm your UC health insurance covers international travel and emergency medical evacuation
- All SCUBA diving researchers should carry DAN (Divers Alert Network) insurance
- Register at [UC Away](https://www.ucop.edu/risk-services-travel/registering.html) for UC travel insurance

## Phone and Communication

**Local SIM cards:** Vini is the main carrier in French Polynesia with 4G coverage on Mo'orea. Buy a prepaid SIM or eSIM at the airport in Papeete before taking the ferry. A 20-40 GB tourist plan costs roughly $35-75 USD for 30 days. This is far cheaper than US carrier roaming.

**WiFi:** The Gump Station provides WiFi, but bandwidth is limited. Do not plan on large data transfers over station internet.

**Emergency numbers (save these in your phone before fieldwork begins):**
- SAMU (emergency medical): 15
- Police: 17
- Fire: 18
- Hospital of Mo'orea (Afareaitu): +689 40 55 22 22
- U.S. Consular Agent in Papeete: +689 40 42 65 35

## Safety

General lab and field safety protocols apply (see the Safety section). Mo'orea-specific hazards are covered below. All first-time travelers will attend a pre-departure safety briefing with Adrian and experienced lab members.

### Medical Facilities

The Hospital of Mo'orea in Afareaitu provides basic emergency care. For serious injuries, surgical emergencies, or critical care, patients must be transferred to Centre Hospitalier de la Polynesie Francaise (CHPF/Taaone Hospital) in Papeete, Tahiti. Transport options include helicopter (dispatched by SAMU, call 15), the high-speed ferry (~30 minutes), or Air Tahiti (~7 minutes).

The nearest hyperbaric (recompression) chamber is at CHPF in Papeete. There is no chamber on Mo'orea. All dive planning must account for this transfer time.

### Ocean Hazards

**Venomous marine life:**
- **Stonefish** are the most dangerous hazard. They are perfectly camouflaged on the reef and in sand. Stepping on one causes extreme pain and requires emergency medical attention. First aid: immerse in hot water (above 45C/113F) for at least 20 minutes. Seek medical care immediately. **Always wear hard-soled reef shoes in the lagoon. Never walk barefoot on the reef or sandy bottom.**
- **Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS):** Venomous spines cause intense pain, swelling, and nausea. Mo'orea has experienced major COTS outbreaks. Wear puncture-resistant gloves when working on the reef.
- **Cone snails** can fire venomous barbed darts. Some species are potentially lethal. Never pick up or handle cone shells.
- **Fire coral** (Millepora spp.) causes immediate burning pain on contact. Rinse with vinegar and apply hydrocortisone.
- **Lionfish and scorpionfish** have venomous spines. First aid: hot water immersion.
- **Sea urchins** (especially Diadema): maintain buoyancy control while diving. Wear booties in the lagoon.

**Sharks:** Mo'orea's waters support healthy shark populations, including blacktip reef sharks (common in the lagoon), grey reef sharks (passes and fore reef), and lemon sharks. They are generally not aggressive toward divers, but follow standard protocols: do not carry bleeding fish, avoid diving passes at dusk or dawn, do not corner or block sharks, and avoid erratic movements.

**Currents:** Tidal currents through reef passes can be very strong and unpredictable. Only experienced divers should work in passes. Always check tide tables and current conditions. Carry surface marker buoys. Never dive passes alone.

**Coral cuts:** The most common field injury. Coral embeds calcareous fragments and marine bacteria (including Vibrio species) into wounds, and tropical infections can escalate quickly. Treatment: flush with diluted hydrogen peroxide to remove debris, rinse with fresh water, apply topical antibiotic 3-4 times daily, and monitor closely. Begin oral antibiotics at the first sign of infection (expanding redness, warmth, pus). Rapidly spreading redness with blisters is a medical emergency. Prevention: wear full wetsuits or lycra suits, maintain buoyancy control, wear gloves.

### Ciguatera

Ciguatera fish poisoning is a real risk on Mo'orea. The toxin originates from dinoflagellates on reef algae and bioaccumulates in reef fish. It cannot be detected by appearance, smell, or taste, and cooking does not destroy it. Symptoms include gastrointestinal distress followed by neurological effects (tingling, cold-hot reversal, joint pain) that can persist for weeks.

Avoid eating large reef predators (barracuda, grouper, snapper, moray eel). Pelagic fish caught in open water (tuna, mahi-mahi) are generally safe. Follow local advice about which areas and species to avoid.

### Heat, Sun, and Mosquitoes

The UV index is extreme year-round. Wear sun-protective clothing, hats, and reef-safe sunscreen. Reapply frequently, especially after diving.

Dengue fever is the most significant mosquito-borne disease risk in French Polynesia. Protect against mosquito bites during daytime hours with DEET repellent and long sleeves at dawn and dusk. Symptoms of dengue include sudden high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, and joint pain. Seek medical attention if you develop these symptoms.

### Climate During Field Season (May-August)

The typical field season falls during the austral dry season. Air temperatures average 28-29C (82-84F) with lows around 21-23C (70-73F). Water temperatures range from 25-28C (77-82F). A 3mm wetsuit is adequate; some researchers prefer a full suit for extended dives in July-August. Southeast trade winds are common (15-25 knots) and can create rough conditions on the windward side of the island. This period is well outside cyclone season (November-April).
