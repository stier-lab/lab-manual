Welcome to the Ocean Recoveries Lab! You are now part of a community working to understand how marine ecosystems collapse and recover, and how we can build resilience in a changing world. This applies whether you are a graduate student, postdoc, technician, or undergraduate researcher.

Our research spans coral reefs in Mo'orea (French Polynesia), kelp forests along the Santa Barbara coast, and Caribbean reef systems. We combine field experiments, evidence synthesis, and predictive modeling to study the mechanisms of ecosystem resistance, recovery, and reorganization. The lab is part of two NSF Long-Term Ecological Research programs: the Moorea Coral Reef LTER and the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER. These programs provide long-term datasets, infrastructure, and collaborative networks that enrich our work. You can learn more about current projects and the broader research program at [oceanrecoveries.com](https://www.oceanrecoveries.com/).

This manual will help you get oriented. It covers the practical logistics of working at UCSB and in our lab. It also lays out the expectations and values that shape how we work together.

This handbook complements several other documents you should know. You and I will complete a Mentor/Mentee Agreement together. The entire lab revisits the Lab Working Agreement each year. You will also create an Individual Development Plan (IDP). Together, these documents make explicit what people often pass along informally. They put everyone on the same page from the start.

This is a living document. If something is unclear, outdated, or missing, please let me or the lab manager (Molly Brzezinski) know.
