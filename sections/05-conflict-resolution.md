# Conflict Resolution

I expect conflicts to arise. That is not a warning. It is just realistic. Put a group of smart, passionate people in close quarters with high-stakes work and real deadlines. Disagreements will happen. Some will involve me, and some will be between other people in the lab. What matters is not whether conflicts occur but how we handle them.

## Start Direct

My expectation is that the people involved talk to each other first. Meet privately, discuss the issue honestly, and try to find a fair resolution. Most conflicts resolve at this stage when both people approach the conversation in good faith. I know this can be uncomfortable, especially across power differentials. But it is almost always better than letting things simmer.

## If That Doesn't Work

If a direct conversation does not resolve things, or if you have tried and it is not getting better:

- **Bring it to me.** I am happy to listen, mediate, or help figure out a path forward. I would much rather hear about a problem early than discover it has been festering for months.

- **If the problem involves me** (and it can, because I am not perfect), please go to Mengshu Ye (Graduate Advisor) or the Department Chair. I mean this sincerely. I would rather you raise it with someone who can help than sit with it silently.

- **For persistent or serious issues,** UCSB's Ombuds Office provides confidential, neutral mediation services. They exist for situations where normal channels feel insufficient.

## A Few Principles I Care About

- **Address things promptly.** Conflicts fester and escalate when ignored. A small misunderstanding today can become a real problem in a month.

- **Assume good intent initially, but hold people accountable for impact.** Someone can mean well and still cause harm. Both things can be true.

- **Talk about people the way you would if they were in the room.** Do not gossip about labmates, and do not speak negatively about someone who is not present. If you have a concern about someone's behavior or work, raise it with them directly or bring it to Adrian. This is a basic standard of professionalism and trust. A lab where people talk behind each other's backs is a lab where no one feels safe.

- **Keep notes.** If you are dealing with a recurring issue, document what happened and when. This protects everyone and makes any later conversation more productive.

- **Retaliation for raising concerns is prohibited, full stop.** I take this seriously, and I expect everyone in the lab to as well.
