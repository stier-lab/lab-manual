# Ocean Recoveries Lab (Stier Lab) Manual

**Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology**
**University of California, Santa Barbara**
*Updated February 26, 2026*

---

Welcome to the Ocean Recoveries Lab! Whether you are a graduate student, post-doc, technician, or undergraduate researcher, you are now part of a community dedicated to understanding how marine ecosystems collapse and recover---and how we can engineer resilience in a rapidly changing world.

Our research spans coral reefs in Mo'orea (French Polynesia), kelp forests along the Santa Barbara coast, and Caribbean reef systems. We combine field experiments, evidence synthesis, and predictive modeling to understand the mechanisms of ecosystem resistance, recovery, and reorganization. The lab is embedded in two NSF Long-Term Ecological Research programs---the Moorea Coral Reef LTER and the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER---which provide long-term datasets, infrastructure, and collaborative networks that enrich our work. You can learn more about current projects and the broader research program at oceanrecoveries.com.

This manual is designed to help you get oriented---both to the practical logistics of working at UCSB and in our lab, and to the expectations and values that shape how we work together.

This handbook complements several other documents you should be familiar with: the Mentor/Mentee Agreement that you and Adrian will complete together, the Lab Working Agreement that the entire lab revisits annually, and your Individual Development Plan (IDP). Together, these documents make explicit what might otherwise be passed along informally, so that everyone starts on the same page.

This is a living document. If something is unclear, outdated, or missing, please let Adrian or the lab manager (Molly Brzezinski) know.

# Lab Values & Culture

## Core Values

I want to be upfront about what matters to me in how we do science and treat each other. These aren't aspirational slogans on a poster---they're the things I come back to when making decisions about the lab, and the things I hope you'll hold me to as well.

- **Curiosity.** I got into this work because I find the natural world genuinely fascinating, and I hope you did too. Curiosity is the engine of good science. I want this lab to be a place where you can explore, sit with uncertainty, and ask the "stupid questions" that often turn out to be the most important ones.

- **Collaboration.** Our best work happens when we combine diverse perspectives, skills, and experiences. I value working together, helping each other, and sharing credit generously.

- **Constructive Criticism.** I expect us to give each other honest feedback on ideas, writing, analyses, and presentations. I try to offer criticism with the intent to improve, and I ask that you receive it with openness rather than defensiveness. That goes both ways---I need your honest reactions to my ideas too.

- **Courage.** I want people in this lab to speak up when they disagree, when something feels wrong, or when they need help. Challenge ideas respectfully, regardless of who holds them---including me.

- **Clarity.** We strive to think clearly and communicate effectively---in our writing, our talks, our experimental designs, and our conversations with each other.

- **Compassion.** I care about you as a whole person, not just as a research producer. We hold each other accountable while remaining sensitive to the pressures and challenges of graduate life.

- **Community.** I value every voice in the lab. We build and sustain our community through shared meals, social time, mutual support, and a culture where everyone feels they belong.

- **Integrity.** We conduct our research honestly, treat our data with respect, and hold ourselves to the highest standards of scientific and professional ethics. There are no shortcuts here.

## Day-to-Day Lab Life

### Be Around

Some of the best scientific insights I've had---and that I've seen students have---came from unplanned conversations. Someone mentions a weird pattern in their data over coffee, and twenty minutes later you've redesigned an experiment. That only happens if people are physically present. I don't expect rigid 9-to-5 hours, and working from home sometimes is completely fine, but I encourage you to make the lab and office your default workspace. The spontaneous interactions matter more than you think.

### Shared Spaces

The lab is communal space, and keeping it functional is everyone's job. A few specifics:

- Wash your dishes. Seriously. The sink is not a staging area.
- Label your samples clearly---your name, date, and what it is. Mysterious unlabeled containers eventually get tossed.
- If supplies are running low, help reorder. If equipment is broken, report it. Don't assume someone else will handle it.
- Leave shared spaces at least as clean as you found them.

### Socializing

I think it matters that people in the lab actually enjoy spending time together. Lab potlucks, beach days, happy hours---whatever form it takes, the social side of lab life is not a distraction from the science. It's part of what makes a lab function well. I encourage it, though I'm not going to prescribe what it looks like.

### Seminars

Attend EEMB seminars, thesis defenses, and other departmental talks when your schedule allows. More importantly, talk about what you heard with labmates afterward. This is how you build intellectual breadth and stay connected to the wider scientific community. I consider it one of the most valuable parts of being at a research university, and I notice when people take advantage of it.

## Roles and Awareness

You will play multiple roles in this lab---student, teacher, mentor to undergrads, peer. Be aware of how your behavior carries different weight in different contexts, especially when there's a power differential. The way you give feedback to an undergraduate mentee is not the same as how you push back on a fellow grad student's interpretation, and both are different from how you raise a concern with me.

---

# Safety

## Harassment and Bullying

Harassment---behavior that makes others uncomfortable, especially when based on gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected characteristics---is prohibited by federal law, UC policy, and the standards of this lab. This includes subtle forms: dismissive comments, unwanted physical contact, patterns of exclusion, or leveraging power dynamics to intimidate.

If you experience or witness harassment or bullying:

- **Talk to the person directly,** if you feel safe doing so. Many offenses are unintentional, and a direct conversation often resolves things.

- **If that's not comfortable, come to Adrian.** He will take your concern seriously and work with you on next steps.

- **If Adrian is the concern,** contact Mengshu Ye (Graduate Advisor), the EEMB Department Chair, or UCSB's Title IX Compliance & Discrimination and Harassment Prevention Office (TIX/DHP) at (805) 893-2701 or tixoffice@titleix.ucsb.edu.

- **For formal complaints,** contact UCSB's Title IX Compliance & Discrimination and Harassment Prevention Office (TIX/DHP) at (805) 893-2701 or tixoffice@titleix.ucsb.edu.

Retaliation against anyone who raises a concern is absolutely prohibited and will be treated as a separate, serious violation. See the Mentor/Mentee Agreement and Lab Working Agreement for specifics on no-retaliation commitments.

**Important Note on Confidentiality:** Under UC policy, all faculty---including Adrian---are Responsible Employees. This means that if you disclose an experience of sexual harassment, sexual violence, relationship violence, or stalking, Adrian is required to report it to the TIX/DHP Office. Adrian cannot promise confidentiality for these matters. If you want to speak with someone confidentially before deciding whether to make a formal report, contact one of these Confidential Resources:

- **CARE** (Campus Advocacy, Resources & Education): Confidential advocacy for sexual violence, relationship violence, and stalking. 24/7 line: (805) 893-4613. Office: Student Resource Building 2145. CARE@sa.ucsb.edu

- **CAPS** (Counseling & Psychological Services): (805) 893-4411. Building 599, next to Storke Tower. Confidential counseling available to all registered students.

- **Ombuds Office:** Confidential, informal, independent, and neutral. 1205-K Girvetz Hall, (805) 893-3285.

These offices will not report to the university without your permission (with narrow exceptions such as imminent danger or child abuse). You do not have to decide anything before talking to them.

## Health and Well-Being

Graduate school is demanding. Taking care of your mental, emotional, and physical health is not optional---it's foundational to doing good work and being a good colleague.

**Work/life balance:** There is no expectation that you work evenings and weekends as a default. Some periods (field seasons, manuscript deadlines) will be more intense than others, and that's normal. But chronic overwork is not a badge of honor---it's a risk factor for burnout, poor science, and poor health. Know your limits and take care of yourself.

**If you're struggling:** Talk to Adrian. You don't need to share details---you have a right to privacy---but letting him know you need time or adjusted expectations helps both of you. If you'd rather talk to someone else, that's fine too. Other lab members, the Graduate Advisor, or campus counseling services are all available.

**Don't come to lab sick.** If you have a physical condition that affects your work, talk to Adrian so accommodations can be made.

See the Mental Health Resources section later in this manual for specific campus services.

## Lab and Field Safety

Do not put yourself or others at risk. If you feel pressured to do something unsafe---by anyone, including Adrian---you have the right and the responsibility to refuse. Speak up.

- **Point of contact:** When conducting fieldwork, always have someone who is NOT in the field with you who knows your location and expected return time. If you don't return on schedule, they should attempt contact and request assistance if needed.

- **SCUBA and boating:** You must meet all UCSB and American Academy of Underwater Sciences (AAUS) requirements before diving. Adrian serves on the MSI diving and boating safety board. See the Required Trainings section and the separate UCSB Dive Safety Manual (available from Eric Hessell or at marineops.ucsb.edu) for details.

- **Lab chemicals:** See the Chemical Health and Safety Plan subsection in Required Trainings. Always check Safety Data Sheets (SDS), complete required Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and ensure you have proper training before handling hazardous materials.

- **Reporting:** Report all safety incidents, near-misses, and equipment failures immediately. There is no penalty for reporting---there is a problem with not reporting.

# Communication Norms

Clear communication is one of those things that sounds obvious but is genuinely hard to get right, especially in a lab where people have different schedules, are sometimes in Mo'orea, and are juggling coursework, teaching, and research. Here's how I prefer we handle it.

## The Basics

- Check email at least once per business day and respond to things that need a response within one business day. You don't need to have the answer---just acknowledge you saw it.

- If you're going to be away from email for more than a day (fieldwork, travel, vacation), let me and relevant labmates know in advance.

- Don't disappear without notice. If you need time away, that's completely fine---but tell someone first.

## How I Use Different Channels

**Slack** is my primary communication tool and the fastest way to reach me. Our workspace is at stierlab.slack.com. I check Slack throughout the day and it's the best channel for anything that needs a timely response---questions, coordination, sharing updates, day-to-day logistics. Use the "Do Not Disturb" settings to protect your evenings---I encourage this.

**Email** is fine for longer-form communication, especially with external collaborators or for things that need a paper trail. But be aware that emails can get lost in my inbox. If something is time-sensitive or you haven't heard back in a day or two, follow up on Slack. I will sometimes send emails at odd hours---evenings, weekends, early mornings. This does not mean I expect a response outside of business hours. I'm writing when something is on my mind so I don't forget, not because I need you to act on it at 10 PM.

Oh, and I like salutations. A "Hi Adrian" at the top of an email goes a long way. It's a small thing, but emails that jump straight into a request read as curt to me, even when I know they're not intended that way.

**Text or phone** --- reserve these for genuinely time-sensitive or urgent matters. If it's a real emergency, call rather than text. I mean things like safety issues in the field, a freezer failure, or something that can't wait until the next business day.

**In person** is best for anything that would devolve into a long email thread. If you find yourself drafting a third reply in the same chain and it's getting complicated, just come knock on my door or schedule a meeting. I almost always prefer a 15-minute conversation over a week of back-and-forth emails.

## A Note on Timing

I encourage communication during roughly standard business hours (8 AM--5 PM). If you're writing after hours, consider using scheduled-send so it arrives in the morning. This isn't a rigid rule---field schedules and time zones sometimes make off-hours communication necessary---but as a default, let's respect each other's non-work time.

---

# Conflict Resolution

I expect conflicts to arise. That's not a warning---it's just realistic. Put a group of smart, passionate people in close quarters, give them high-stakes work with real deadlines, and disagreements will happen. Some will involve me, and some will be between other people in the lab. What matters is not whether conflicts occur but how we handle them.

## Start Direct

My expectation is that the people involved talk to each other first. Meet privately, discuss the issue honestly, and try to find a fair resolution. Most conflicts resolve at this stage when both people approach the conversation in good faith. I know this can be uncomfortable, especially across power differentials, but it is almost always better than letting things simmer.

## If That Doesn't Work

If a direct conversation doesn't resolve things, or if you've tried and it's not getting better:

- **Bring it to me.** I'm happy to listen, mediate, or help figure out a path forward. I'd much rather hear about a problem early than discover it's been festering for months.

- **If the problem involves me** --- and it might; I'm not perfect --- please go to Mengshu Ye (Graduate Advisor) or the Department Chair. I mean this sincerely. I would rather you raise it with someone who can help than sit with it silently.

- **For persistent or serious issues,** UCSB's Ombuds Office provides confidential, neutral mediation services. They exist precisely for situations where normal channels feel insufficient.

## A Few Principles I Care About

- **Address things promptly.** Conflicts fester and escalate when ignored. A small misunderstanding today can become a real problem in a month.

- **Assume good intent initially, but hold people accountable for impact.** Someone can mean well and still cause harm. Both things can be true.

- **Keep notes.** If you're dealing with a recurring issue, document what happened and when. This protects everyone and makes any later conversation more productive.

- **Retaliation for raising concerns is prohibited---full stop.** I take this seriously, and I expect everyone in the lab to as well.

# Required Trainings

There are several required trainings to complete before you can get to work. It can feel like a lot of paperwork, but these trainings keep you, your labmates, and our study organisms safe. Work through them systematically in your first few weeks.

## Basic Training

**Step 1:** Log in to the UC Learning Center (www.learningcenter.ucsb.edu). Employees log in with UCNetID. Graduate students and volunteers use the Non-Employee login---email ehstraining@ehs.ucsb.edu with your name, UCNetID, email, affiliation type, and PI name.

**Step 2:** Complete the following trainings:

- Cyber Security Awareness Training
- Fundamentals of Laboratory Safety (grad students: in-person during orientation; post-docs/undergrads: online LS60; technicians: live or online)
- UC Preventing Harassment & Discrimination (formerly UC Sexual Harassment Training)
- Gateway 101 (only if you will be ordering supplies)

## LHAT (Laboratory Hazard Assessment Tool) Training

- Step 1: Remind Adrian or the designated lab member to add you to the Stier Lab LHAT Group.
- Step 2: Schedule time with a senior lab member to review lab-specific procedures, hazards, and emergencies per the EHS Training Needs Assessment Form.
- Once complete, sign the form and give to Adrian for approval. Get personal protective equipment (PPE) from the stockroom in Chemistry (room 1432).

## Animal Care Training

To work with animals at UCSB, email the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at iacuc@lifesci.ucsb.edu with your name, PI (Dr. Adrian Stier), and protocol information. Complete the IACUC Researcher Training Checklist, register at citiprogram.org (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) with UCSB, and complete the required modules.

Note: Even SCUBA surveys involving fish may require IACUC approval. If your research involves fish at all, thoroughly review IACUC requirements before deciding you don't need a protocol. Creating a new IACUC protocol takes at least 2 months---plan accordingly.

## Chemical Health and Safety Plan

When you order a new chemical not previously in the lab, print an SDS and add it to the Chemical Health and Safety Binder in Noble 2224. If the chemical is hazardous, check for additional training requirements and complete any needed SOPs.

For new, potentially dangerous protocols, fill out an SOP and add it to both the binder and the shared Drive folder (Admin > EH&S). Before training others, refer them to the documentation first.

# Undergraduates in the Lab

Undergraduates are a welcome and important part of our lab community. Most will work under the guidance of a graduate student or post-doc, but Adrian should be aware of all undergraduate projects and be consulted on any issues that arise.

## Expectations for Mentors

- Undergraduates should not be treated as free labor. Their experience should be genuinely educational.
- Ensure they understand the purpose of the work they're doing, not just the mechanics.
- Provide regular feedback and check-ins.
- Help them develop skills progressively---don't just assign the same repetitive task indefinitely.

## Expectations for Undergraduates

- Treat the lab, equipment, and shared spaces with care.
- Communicate proactively about scheduling, availability, and any issues.
- Attend lab meetings when possible---even just observing is valuable.
- Ask questions. Everyone started where you are.

## Research Opportunities

We encourage undergraduates to develop their own research projects, present at lab meetings, and present posters at events like URCA Week (the UCSB Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities poster colloquium). We also encourage students to apply for funding through programs like UCSB's URCA grants. Graduate mentors should help facilitate these opportunities.

Most undergraduates join as volunteers, for course credit, or with stipend support. We recognize that volunteering is not financially feasible for all students and will work to ensure equitable access to research experience regardless of financial situation.

Undergraduate researchers must complete the same basic safety trainings as other lab members---see the Required Trainings section for details.

---

# Graduate Student Funding

Funding is one of the most important---and sometimes most stressful---aspects of graduate school. Adrian's goal is that you never have to worry about whether you can afford to stay in the program. This section lays out how funding works so you can plan ahead and take advantage of the opportunities available.

## Stipend & Support

EEMB faculty aim to fully support their students in good standing for the duration of their studies through a combination of Teaching Assistantships, Graduate Student Researcher positions, and fellowships. Unlike some UCSB departments, EEMB does not offer a formal multi-year guaranteed funding package---funding depends on the admitting faculty member's grants and resources. The department has limited funds and tries to support students through their first year; after that, Adrian works with each student to piece together support from TA lines, grants, and fellowships.

In practice, your support will typically come from a combination of:

- **Teaching Assistantships (TA):** All EEMB students are required to TA at least 2 quarters. Each faculty member can generally count on TA support for one student per year (3 quarters of total support). TA appointments at 25%+ provide partial fee remission (tuition, student service fee, campus-based fees, and UC Student Health Insurance Plan [UC-SHIP]). Standard appointments are 50% time.

- **Graduate Student Researcher (GSR):** Funded through Adrian's grants. GSR appointments at 35%+ provide full fee remission, including non-resident supplemental tuition (NRST). At 25--34%, only partial fee remission applies (no NRST coverage).

- **Fellowships:** Campus and external fellowships supplement TA/GSR support.

Discuss your funding picture with Adrian and the Graduate Advisor (Mengshu Ye) at the start of each academic year.

## Summer Funding

Summer support is not automatic, so plan ahead. The department's block grant funds can provide summer stipends, but these are competitive---you must apply with a statement of need and a faculty nomination. Other sources include GSR positions (if Adrian has summer grant funding), summer TAships (limited, separate application), and external fellowships (e.g., NSF GRFP provides 12-month support including summer). It's wise to budget based on your 9-month salary and treat summer funding as a welcome supplement. Talk to Adrian early each spring about summer plans.

## Fee Remission & NRST

Understanding fee remission is important, especially for international and out-of-state students:

- **TA (25%+):** Partial fee remission covers tuition, student service fee, campus fees, and UC-SHIP. Does NOT cover NRST.
- **GSR (35%+):** Full fee remission covers everything above PLUS NRST.
- **International students:** The International Doctoral Recruitment Fellowship (IDRF) automatically covers NRST from your 4th quarter through advancement to candidacy. After advancing, NRST is waived for 3 years (9 quarters). Your first year's NRST (~$15,000) must come from other sources (GSR at 35%+, departmental fellowship, or similar).

## Fellowships

Apply for external fellowships---especially the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship (GRFP). Note: as of the FY2026 solicitation, only first-year graduate students are eligible to apply (second-year students are no longer eligible). This means you should begin preparing your application before you arrive or very early in your first year. The application takes several months of serious writing and revision. Start early, get feedback from labmates and Adrian, and plan multiple drafts. Fellowship funding benefits you directly (often higher stipend, more independence) and frees up lab resources for other students.

Other fellowships to consider:
- **External:** Ford Foundation Fellowship, Fulbright, NDSEG, Nancy Foster Scholarship (NOAA)
- **UCSB campus (department-nominated):** Chancellor's Fellowship, Regents Fellowship, Eugene Cota-Robles Fellowship
- **EEMB-specific:** Charles A. Storke Award ($2,500), Ellen Schamberg Burley Award (travel)
- **Graduate Division:** Dissertation Fellowship, Broida-Hirschfelder Fellowship ($5,000--$10,500)

New applicants are automatically considered for campus fellowship competitions. The department strongly encourages extramural pre-doctoral fellowship applications.

## Research Expenses

Part of becoming an independent scientist is learning to fund your own research. Adrian will help you identify funding sources and will support your work through his grants when your project aligns with them, but you should also be writing and submitting small grants throughout your program (e.g., Sigma Xi, UCSB departments, disciplinary societies, UC Natural Reserve System Mathias Grants). Design projects that are financially feasible, and talk to Adrian before purchasing anything from his accounts. Always know the correct funding source/speed type for any purchase. See the Purchasing, Shipping, and Reimbursement section for logistics.

## Conferences

You are generally responsible for conference costs. Available travel support:

- **Ellen Schamberg Burley Award** (EEMB): For advanced doctoral candidates presenting at scientific meetings
- **Academic Senate Doctoral Student Travel Grant:** $450 (CA), $900 (US), $1,500 (international) --- must be advanced to candidacy
- **GSA Conference Travel Grant:** Up to $200 reimbursement --- for students NOT yet advanced to candidacy
- **Adrian's grants:** If your presentation is related to an active grant, he may be able to help
- Some conferences offer registration fee waivers for student volunteers

See the Travel section for booking procedures, travel advances, and reimbursement logistics.

## Your Union: UAW Local 4811

As a graduate student employee at UCSB---whether you hold a TA or GSR appointment---you are a member of **UAW Local 4811** (United Auto Workers). This is the union that represents over 48,000 academic workers across all 10 UC campuses. Dues are automatically deducted from your paycheck.

UAW 4811 was formed through a 2023 merger of two earlier unions: UAW Local 2865 (which represented Teaching Assistants, Readers, and Tutors) and Student Researchers United / SRU-UAW (which represented Graduate Student Researchers). The merger brought all graduate student employees under one bargaining unit.

**The 2022 strike.** In November 2022, approximately 48,000 UC academic workers walked off the job in what became the largest higher education strike in U.S. history. The strike lasted roughly six weeks and resulted in significant gains: minimum salaries for graduate employees increased by approximately 46%, parental leave was expanded to 8 weeks of fully paid leave, childcare reimbursements were established, and new workplace protections against abusive conduct were written into the contract.

**Where things stand now.** The 2022 contracts expired in May 2025, and new negotiations are ongoing. Labor relations at the UC are an evolving situation, and they will likely continue to evolve throughout your time here. I encourage you to stay informed about your contract and your rights, regardless of your personal feelings about unions. Understanding your contract helps you understand your pay, your workload limits (a 50% appointment means a maximum of 20 hours per week), your grievance rights, and the protections available to you.

**Key resources:**
- **UAW 4811 website:** uaw4811.org --- contract text, bargaining updates, know-your-rights information
- **Your campus steward:** Contact info available on the UAW 4811 website. If you have a question about your contract or think something isn't right with your appointment, your steward can help

# Graduate Program Guidance

Note: This section supplements the official EEMB Graduate Student Handbooks (PhD and MS), which are available on the EEMB website. Familiarize yourself with the current handbook for your degree program---it contains the definitive requirements for committee formation, qualifying exams, and degree completion.

## All Graduate Students

**Weekly meetings:** At the start of each quarter, Adrian schedules weekly or biweekly one-on-one meetings with each student. This time is yours. You set the agenda. If you don't have anything to discuss one week, cancel---but if you cancel several weeks in a row, expect Adrian to check in.

**Committee formation:** Form your committee during your first year. Per EEMB requirements, you need a minimum of 3 members: at least 2 must be ladder faculty from EEMB (including the chair), and the third can be from another department or UC campus. Think of your committee as a team with complementary expertise. Adrian will offer suggestions, but the decision is yours.

**Developing your research question:** There is no single right way to find a research question. Some people arrive with a burning question they've been thinking about for years. Others start with a system they're drawn to---a reef, a species interaction, a place---and the question emerges from spending time in that system. In practice, most of us do a messy mix of both: we explore a system, read the literature, notice gaps or puzzles, and iterate back and forth between questions and observations until something clicks.

I'd encourage you to read broadly, including well outside your immediate subfield. Go to seminars in departments you wouldn't normally visit. Talk to people in other labs about their work---not because you'll switch fields, but because the most interesting questions often live at the boundaries between disciplines. The first research question you land on will almost certainly evolve, and that's normal and healthy. A question that doesn't change as you learn more probably means you aren't learning enough.

My role in this process differs depending on where you are. For PhD students, developing an original research question is a core part of the training---arguably the core part. I'll push back, suggest readings, point you toward gaps I find exciting, and help you refine your thinking, but the question needs to ultimately be yours. For MS students, given the compressed timeline, I'll be more hands-on in helping define the scope and may suggest a question directly. Either way, we'll talk about this a lot in our one-on-one meetings, especially in your first year.

**Teaching Assistantships:** All EEMB students are required to TA at least 2 quarters, and TA support is a significant part of most funding packages. Classes vary considerably in their workload---some are straightforward and leave you plenty of time for research, while others are intensive and require significant weekly prep. The best way to figure out which classes work for you is to ask other grad students who've TAed them recently. Your fellow students are the most honest and up-to-date source on what to expect. I'm happy to weigh in too, but the student grapevine is your best bet for the real picture.

**Annual progress reports:** EEMB requires an annual Progress Report and Study Plan, filed with your committee. This ensures you and your committee agree on where you are and what comes next. Your committee will meet at least once per year to review progress.

**Individual Development Plans:** All students complete and review an IDP annually. The IDP sets milestones, tracks progress, and provides structure for conversations about your professional development. Quarterly check-ins supplement the annual review.

**Practice talks:** Practice your research presentations before every conference, in lab meeting or individually with labmates. The first practice talk usually reveals that a talk you thought was "almost done" needs to be restructured. This is normal. Give yourself time---do not wait until the last minute.

**Publications:** Write and submit papers as you progress through your program. Do not wait until the end. Ideally, most of your publishable work will be in review or published by the time you defend. This makes your next career transition dramatically easier.

**Committee review of manuscripts:** Provide each manuscript to your committee and incorporate feedback before submitting to a journal. This avoids the situation where a committee member has concerns about published work at your defense.

**Required coursework (Year 1):** All EEMB graduate students must complete EEMB 500 (Campus Orientation), 507 (Introduction to Graduate Research), 508 and 509 (Levels of Biological Organization I & II), 290 (Introduction to Faculty Research), and 502 (Teaching Techniques).

## MS Students

Target: file your thesis by the end of your second year. The maximum time allowed by EEMB is 4 years. This is fast, so there's little time to waste. Adrian is more inclined to directly help MS students define or refine a research question than he would be with PhD students, given the compressed timeline. Starting research the summer before you matriculate can give you a meaningful head start.

MS students can choose Plan I (thesis, minimum 30 units) or Plan II (comprehensive exam, minimum 36 units). Discuss with Adrian which path makes sense for your goals.

## PhD Students

Target: 6 years to completion (EEMB normative time). Key milestones per EEMB requirements:

- **Year 1:** Complete core coursework. Form your committee. Begin research. Complete at least one quarter of TA.

- **Year 2:** Complete both written qualifying exams (two fields chosen in consultation with your committee---one in ecology/evolution, one in a related field). This is a firm deadline set by the department. Students who fall behind on exams will receive a warning and must work with their committee and the Graduate Advisor to get back on track.

- **Year 3:** Complete the oral qualifying exam (present your dissertation proposal to your committee, followed by broad questioning). Advance to candidacy by filing Doctoral Form II with the Graduate Division ($50 fee). Advancement triggers the 3-year NRST waiver for international students.

- **Years 3--6:** Dissertation research, writing, and regular annual committee meetings with progress reports.

- **Defense:** Aim to defend in Fall or Spring, not Summer. Faculty aren't paid in summer, many are in the field, and fewer colleagues will be around to help you prepare and celebrate. Note: EEMB allows a public seminar of your dissertation research as an alternative to a traditional oral defense---discuss with your committee.

- **Beyond normative time:** If you go beyond 6 years, additional steps are required: at year 7, you must petition the Graduate Committee and Graduate Dean to continue. At year 8, you may need to retake written exams or demonstrate currency. The university maximum is 10 years, but the goal is to finish well before that. If you're approaching normative time, talk to Adrian and your committee early about a realistic completion plan.

## Escalation and Support Within EEMB

If you have questions or concerns beyond what Adrian can address:

1. **Staff Graduate Advisor (Mengshu Ye):** Administrative and technical questions---timetables, forms, requirements, petitions.
2. **Faculty Graduate Advisor (Hillary Young):** Academic questions, issues with your studies or your relationship with your major professor.
3. **Department Chair (Todd Oakley):** If the Faculty Graduate Advisor cannot resolve the issue satisfactorily.

# Mentoring and Advising Structure

The lab uses several structured tools to ensure transparent, consistent mentoring:

- **Mentor/Mentee Agreement:** You and Adrian complete this at the start of your program. It covers goals, expectations, communication preferences, work style, and how to handle problems. Revisited annually.

- **Lab Working Agreement:** The whole lab reviews and signs this yearly. It codifies shared values around communication, process, and collaboration.

- **Individual Development Plans (IDPs):** Annual review with quarterly check-ins. Covers research milestones, skills development, and career planning.

- **Annual meetings with Graduate Advisor:** All students meet with the Graduate Advisor (currently Mengshu Ye) yearly (for at least the first two years) to provide feedback on mentorship. Adrian also meets with the Graduate Advisor to address any concerns.

## What Adrian Commits To

- Timely feedback on written work within agreed-upon timelines.
- Quarterly milestone tracking aligned with your IDP.
- Documented meeting summaries shared after each advising meeting.
- Written role descriptions for GSR/TA responsibilities each quarter, including clear delineation of paid vs. voluntary tasks.
- A written description of how student accomplishments enable recommendation letters, provided at the start of the advising relationship.
- Monthly updates to the Department Chair and Graduate Advisor (Mengshu Ye) on lab climate and student progress.

## What Students Commit To

- Active participation in IDP development and quarterly reviews.
- Proactive communication about problems, delays, or concerns---early rather than late.
- Engaging constructively with feedback, even when it's uncomfortable.
- Contributing to lab community: attending lab meetings, helping maintain shared spaces, supporting labmates.

# Authorship Policy

Authorship is one of the primary currencies of academic science. Getting it right matters for careers, relationships, and the integrity of the scientific record. There is no universal standard, but here is how we approach it in this lab.

I want to be candid about this topic because I think most labs don't talk about it enough, and the confusion that results can damage relationships. There is no hard and fast rule for authorship---the norms vary across disciplines, across labs, and even across projects. Your own authorship philosophy will evolve over the course of your career. What follows is where I've landed, but I hold it loosely and I'm always willing to talk it through.

## Who Qualifies as an Author?

Authorship should reflect genuine intellectual contribution to the work. At minimum, an author should have contributed substantively to one or more of the following: conception of the idea, study design, data collection, data analysis/interpretation, or writing the manuscript. Simply providing funding, published data (already credited elsewhere), or minor editorial comments does not typically warrant authorship---those contributions belong in the Acknowledgements.

The line between "acknowledgement" and "authorship" is genuinely hard, and I don't think anyone has a clean formula for it. Lab meetings improve everyone's science, but participating in lab meeting doesn't make you a co-author on every paper discussed there. Writing suggestions might or might not cross the threshold---a few comments on phrasing are different from restructuring an argument. Funding alone doesn't qualify either, even if I wrote the grant that supported the work. The honest answer is that these cases require judgment and conversation, not rules. When in doubt, err toward inclusion early in your career. But do not offer authorship so freely that it devalues the substantive contributions of others.

One practical suggestion: keep a running list of who contributed what as a project develops. It's much easier to have an authorship conversation when you can point to a concrete record of contributions rather than relying on memory after the paper is written.

## Authorship Order

I use the "PI is last" convention that is standard in ecology. For papers led by students or post-docs, the first author is the person who led the project and the writing effort. Other authors are listed in decreasing order of contribution, with me typically in the last position as the senior or supervising author. For papers I lead, authors are listed in order of decreasing contribution.

The first author, in consultation with the rest of the team, ultimately decides on author order. If there are disagreements, bring them to me and we'll work it out together.

## Corresponding and Contact Author

My default is that the first author serves as both the corresponding author and the contact author. It's your project---own it. You handle the journal correspondence, the reviewer responses, and any post-publication inquiries. This is good practice for your career, and it signals to the field that the work is yours.

There are exceptions. If you're leaving academia and may not maintain an active email, or if you'll be unreachable for an extended period (say, a long field season without internet), we can designate someone else. But the default is that the person who led the work is the person the world contacts about it.

## When Adrian Expects to Be a Co-Author

I don't expect to be on every paper that comes out of this lab, and I want to be clear about that. If the work is closely tied to one of my grants---using funding I secured, building on questions central to the grant---co-authorship is typical. If your research has grown into something quite distinct from my own program, it may not include me, and that's fine. I'd rather have a healthy mentoring relationship than an inflated publication list.

I'd like to co-author at least one chapter of your dissertation, but it's not required. Here's what I want you to understand: the editorial guidance I give you---reading drafts, suggesting analyses, helping you sharpen arguments---is free. That's part of the job, and it's a part I genuinely love. You never need to worry that asking for feedback creates an obligation. If I am a co-author, I'll invest even more energy in the manuscript, but the baseline level of support doesn't change either way.

## When to Discuss Authorship

- **Early.** Discuss expected authorship when a project is being planned. This isn't binding---contributions change over the life of a project---but it sets expectations and motivates engagement.

- **As the project develops.** Revisit the authorship list as new people contribute or as roles shift. A conversation halfway through is much less awkward than a surprise at the end.

- **Before submission.** Revisit and confirm authorship and order with all co-authors before you hit "submit." This includes conference abstracts, not just journal papers.

- **When things change.** If you're considering adding or removing an author, communicate the rationale to all existing co-authors first.

## Key Rules

- Never submit a paper (including conference abstracts) without explicit approval from all listed co-authors.

- All co-authors should have the opportunity to review the manuscript before submission.

- Get explicit sign-off on the final version from every author before you click "submit." This applies to conference abstracts too---they are part of the scientific record.

- If you're unsure whether someone's contribution warrants authorship, ask them. Ask me. Talk about it before it becomes a problem.

# Data Management and Reproducible Science

## Why This Matters

Since I started as a graduate student, the field has moved increasingly toward reproducibility and open science. These are welcome changes---they make our science better and more trustworthy, even though they add work. I was fortunate to train with Craig Osenberg, who instilled in me the importance of transparency and rigor in how we handle data and report results. That ethos shapes how this lab operates.

Good data management protects your work, enables reproducibility, and ensures that data collected with public funds remains accessible to the scientific community. It also protects you---years from now, you'll be glad you documented what you did.

## Data Storage & Backup

- All research data should be backed up in at least two locations (e.g., UCSB Box + external hard drive, or NAS + UCSB Box). Note: Google Drive is limited to 150 GB per account, so use the lab NAS or UCSB Box (unlimited) for large datasets.
- Do not rely solely on a personal laptop. Hard drives fail.
- The lab NAS (stier-nas1) is backed up regularly. You can maintain a personal folder there for your project data.
- UCSB Box provides unlimited cloud storage as an additional backup option.

## Data Formatting & Documentation

- Store data in CSV format as the primary archival format. Excel is fine for data entry, but CSV ensures long-term readability.
- Use simple, flat structure: rows and columns, no embedded subtables or summary calculations within data files.
- Avoid special characters in column headers.
- Include a metadata file (README) with every dataset explaining variables, units, collection methods, and relevant context.
- Use clear, consistent naming conventions for files and variables. Include date stamps in filenames.

## Code & Analysis

- Write code so that someone else (or future you) can understand it. Comment your code. Use consistent style.
- Make your analysis reproducible: someone should be able to run your code on your raw data and reproduce your results.
- Archive your code alongside your data in a repository (e.g., GitHub, Dryad, Zenodo) when you publish.

## Coding and Analysis Tools

- **R** is the primary language in the lab. Most analyses, figures, and data processing are done in R.
- We use **RStudio** as our development environment and **RStudio Projects** to organize work. Using projects keeps your file paths relative and your work portable---do not use `setwd()` in scripts.
- **Tidyverse** packages (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, etc.) are widely used in the lab. The [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) is a good starting point for learning clean, readable coding habits.
- **R Markdown** and **Quarto** are valuable for creating reproducible analyses that combine code, results, and narrative in a single document. Consider using them for analysis reports and supplementary materials.
- **GitHub** is used for version control and collaboration on code. All analysis code for published papers should live in a lab GitHub repository.
- If you're new to R, talk to labmates---there's always someone willing to help you get started. Learning to code is a normal part of joining the lab, and no one expects you to arrive as an expert.

## Lab Policy on Data After Departure

When you leave the lab, your research data and code should be archived on the lab NAS and/or Google Drive with appropriate metadata. This applies even if the research was not funded by Adrian's grants.

No one will publish your unpublished data without your permission for at least three years after your departure. After three years, Adrian reserves the right to publish the work---most likely with you as lead author. The strong expectation is that you publish your own work within a couple of years of graduating.

For work funded by external grants, data archiving requirements from the funding agency (e.g., NSF, NOAA) apply and may require public data availability on a specific timeline.

## Research Data Ownership

Under the UC Research Data Policy (effective July 2022), research data generated during university research are owned by the University. Students must collect, manage, and share research data in accordance with their discipline's standards, UC/UCSB policies, and applicable legal requirements. Data from grant-funded research must be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). This does not change the lab's practical policies above---it means your data practices must meet both lab and university standards.

For the lab's AI use policy, see the separate AI Use Policy section.

# Gender Equity and Lab Climate

## Our Commitment

Science benefits from diverse perspectives, and a healthy lab climate is everyone's responsibility. The Stier Lab is committed to creating an environment where all members---regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, socioeconomic background, or career stage---can do their best work and feel valued.

## What We Do

- **Annual task and opportunity audit:** Adrian regularly reviews task distribution, authorship opportunities, conference invitations, and mentoring loads across the lab to check for patterns of inequity. If imbalances are found, they are discussed openly and corrected.

- **Annual anonymous climate survey:** Each year, the lab conducts an anonymous survey to gauge lab climate, workload clarity, sense of belonging, and whether all lab members feel supported. Results are shared with the lab (in aggregate) and used to guide concrete changes.

- **Equitable speaking time:** In lab meetings and group discussions, we actively work to ensure everyone has space to contribute. If you notice that certain voices consistently dominate or are overlooked, say something---to the person, to Adrian, or in the anonymous survey.

- **Inclusive mentoring:** Graduate students mentoring undergraduates should be mindful of the additional barriers that first-generation, low-income, and underrepresented students may face. The lab is committed to providing equitable access to research opportunities regardless of a student's ability to volunteer unpaid time.

## Raising Concerns

If you notice inequitable patterns---in task assignments, speaking time, credit for ideas, access to resources, or anything else---raise it. You can do so:

- Directly with Adrian
- Through the annual anonymous survey
- Through the Graduate Advisor (Mengshu Ye) or Faculty Graduate Advisor (Hillary Young)
- Through UCSB's Office of Equal Opportunity & Discrimination Prevention

You should never feel that raising an equity concern will affect your standing in the lab. See the Safety section for formal reporting channels and confidential resources.

# AI Use Policy

## University Policy Context

UCSB does not have a blanket university-wide AI policy. Under current guidance from the Office of Teaching and Learning (May 2023), the use of AI-assistive technology for writing is not allowed in courses, theses, dissertations, or research articles unless specifically permitted by the instructor or supervisor. The UCSB Student Conduct Code classifies unauthorized use of AI programs to complete coursework as academic dishonesty.

For research (as opposed to coursework), AI use is governed by your supervisor's policies---which is what the rest of this section covers.

EEMB does not have a department-level AI policy. This lab policy fills that gap.

## Lab Policy on AI Tools

The Stier Lab embraces AI tools as part of our research workflow. Used well, they accelerate literature discovery, improve code quality, and help with brainstorming and writing. Used carelessly, they introduce errors, fabricate citations, and undermine scientific integrity.

### Tools We Use

The lab actively uses the following AI tools:

- **Claude / Claude Code:** For code generation, debugging, data analysis assistance, and writing feedback
- **NotebookLM:** For synthesizing and querying collections of research papers and notes
- **Research Rabbit:** For literature discovery, citation mapping, and finding related papers
- **Other tools as they emerge:** The AI landscape changes rapidly. New tools may be adopted as they prove useful. Discuss with Adrian before integrating a new tool into a published workflow.

### Permitted Uses

- **Literature search and discovery:** Using AI tools to find relevant papers, map citation networks, and summarize bodies of literature
- **Code generation and debugging:** Using AI to write, debug, and optimize R, Python, or other analysis code
- **Brainstorming:** Using AI to generate hypotheses, explore experimental designs, or think through analytical approaches
- **Writing assistance:** Using AI for feedback on drafts, improving clarity, restructuring arguments, or overcoming writer's block
- **Data exploration:** Using AI to help visualize data, identify patterns, or suggest appropriate statistical approaches

### Requirements

- **Verify everything.** AI tools hallucinate---they generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information, including fabricated citations. Every factual claim, citation, statistical method, and code output must be independently verified before use.
- **Never use unverified AI output as final text or data.** AI-generated text is a starting point or a tool for revision, not a finished product. AI-generated code must be tested and understood before being incorporated into an analysis pipeline.
- **Cite AI use in publications.** When AI tools contributed substantively to a manuscript (e.g., code generation, analysis design, significant text revision), disclose this in the Methods or Acknowledgements section following the journal's guidelines. Many journals now have explicit AI disclosure requirements.
- **Understand your code.** If AI generates analysis code for you, you must understand what every line does. You are responsible for the correctness of your analysis, not the AI.
- **Do not input unpublished data into public AI tools without permission.** Some AI tools (particularly web-based ones) may retain or train on user inputs. Do not paste unpublished data, manuscripts in preparation, or grant proposals into tools unless you are confident about their data handling policies. When in doubt, use local/private instances or ask Adrian.
- **Coursework rules are separate.** For courses you are taking or TAing, follow the instructor's AI policy, which may be more restrictive than this lab policy. When in doubt, ask the instructor.

### What AI Cannot Replace

- Your scientific judgment and critical thinking
- Your understanding of the biological system you study
- Your responsibility for the accuracy and integrity of your work
- Peer review, committee feedback, and collegial discussion
- The process of learning to write, analyze, and think independently

### Staying Current

AI capabilities and university policies are evolving rapidly. This policy will be reviewed and updated annually. If you encounter a situation not covered here, ask Adrian.

# Departure and Offboarding

Before you leave the lab, please complete the following:

- **Archive your data.** All datasets, code, and metadata should be archived on the lab NAS and/or Google Drive. Published data should also be in Dryad, Zenodo, or another appropriate repository. See the Data Management and Reproducible Science section for details on formats, metadata requirements, and the lab's data-after-departure policy.

- **Clean out your samples.** Remove or properly dispose of samples from freezers, the wet lab, and any shared spaces. If another student will continue processing them, coordinate the handoff explicitly.

- **Return keys and equipment.** Return all lab keys, equipment, and shared items. Notify Andi Jorgensen (amjorgen@ucsb.edu) about building access removal.

- **Update documentation.** If you maintained any protocols, equipment logs, or shared documents, make sure they're current and another lab member knows where to find them.

- **Transfer institutional knowledge.** Spend time with the student(s) who will carry on related work. Walk them through your systems, your data, your quirky equipment workarounds.

- **Return the truck keys.** If you had a set, make sure they're back in the designated location.

## Staying Connected

Leaving the lab doesn't mean leaving the community. Former lab members are always welcome at lab meetings, lab events, and Mo'orea field seasons if logistics allow. The door stays open.

I genuinely want to stay in touch---not just for references and collaborations, but because the relationships formed in this lab matter to me beyond the work itself. I've been lucky to watch people grow into incredible scientists, and I care about where those paths lead.

Many former lab members continue to collaborate, co-author papers, and support current students long after they've moved on. By leaving the Stier Lab, you're not ending a chapter---you're joining a broader network that extends well beyond your time at UCSB. Some of the best ideas and partnerships I've been part of came from staying connected with former students and postdocs.

On the practical side: keep your contact info updated so I can reach you (and so I can send a reference letter to the right address). Stay on the lab Slack if you want---there's no expiration date on membership. And don't be a stranger. Send an email, share a paper, tell me about the cool thing you're working on. I want to hear about it.

# Mo'orea Fieldwork

## Overview

Much of the Stier Lab's research takes place on the island of Mo'orea in French Polynesia. Field seasons are a defining part of the graduate experience in this lab---they're where your ideas meet the reef, and where some of the most formative learning happens. They're also logistically complex, physically demanding, and culturally rich. This section covers what you need to know.

## The Gump Station

We are based at the UC Berkeley Richard B. Gump South Pacific Research Station, located on Cook's Bay, Mo'orea. The station provides:

- **Housing:** On-station housing is available for researchers. Coordinate with Adrian and the station manager well in advance, as space fills up during peak season.
- **Lab space:** Wet and dry lab facilities are available at the station. Discuss your specific needs with Adrian before arriving so space and equipment can be arranged.
- **Meals:** Meals are self-cooked. There is a shared kitchen at the station, and grocery stores are accessible on the island. Budget and plan accordingly.

## Timing and Duration

A typical field season runs approximately 3 months during the summer, often starting in May. Not every student goes every year---timing depends on your research stage and project needs. Discuss field season plans with Adrian well before the start of the calendar year so that travel, permits, and funding can be arranged.

## Travel and Funding

Mo'orea trips are typically funded through Adrian's grants. All travel should be booked through Connexxus (UCSB's travel booking portal). For international travel, you must also register at ehs.ucop.edu/away to be covered by UC travel insurance.

Start the booking and paperwork process early---international travel through university systems takes longer than you'd expect.

## Research Permits

Research in French Polynesia requires permits. These are one of the least exciting but most critical parts of international fieldwork---you cannot conduct research without them, and failing to obtain proper permits jeopardizes the lab's long-term access to the site.

- **Protocole d'accueil:** A research permit (Protocole d'accueil) is required to travel to Mo'orea and conduct research at the Gump Station. The Gump Station staff can help facilitate this process, but you need to plan well ahead---applications can take weeks to months.
- **CITES permits:** If your research involves returning coral samples (or other CITES-listed organisms) to the United States, you will need a CITES export permit from French Polynesia and a CITES import permit from the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Start this process early---it is one of the most time-consuming pieces of international fieldwork logistics.
- **Housing reservations:** Housing at the Gump Station is booked through the UC Natural Reserve System (UCNRS) reservation system at https://rams.ucnrs.org/
- **General advice:** Start the permit process as early as possible and keep Adrian informed of your progress. Build in extra time for delays, especially if this is your first trip.

## Equipment and Shipping

- **Large equipment** is typically shipped to the station in advance. Work with Adrian and Molly Brzezinski (lab manager) on shipping logistics, customs requirements, and timing.
- **Smaller gear and personal equipment** is often brought in duffel bags. Pack thoughtfully---replacement parts and specialty items are not easy to find on the island.
- We maintain shared equipment at the Gump Station, including field supplies (transect tapes, zip-locks, vials), lab equipment (balances, microscopes), and dive gear. These are available to all lab members working in Mo'orea. Items need to be replaced as they are used, lost, or destroyed---please help maintain a current inventory.
- Make an equipment list and review it with Adrian and experienced lab members before your first trip.

## Being a Guest in Mo'orea

Mo'orea is not just a field site---it is home to a Polynesian community with a deep cultural history, including a colonial history that shapes daily life. As visiting researchers, you are guests. Keep this in mind:

- **Learn some French and Tahitian.** French is the administrative language and what you'll use in stores, restaurants, and with many community members. Even basic Tahitian greetings and phrases go a long way toward building goodwill and showing respect. Make the effort.
- **Be respectful of local customs, spaces, and relationships.** You are representing UCSB, the Gump Station, and this lab. How you conduct yourself affects the community's willingness to host future researchers.
- **Engage genuinely.** The relationships between the station and the local community matter enormously. Be a thoughtful neighbor, not just a visiting scientist.

## Pre-Trip Checklist

**[To be completed --- items to include: required trainings, travel paperwork, permit status, equipment inventory, insurance registration, emergency contacts, health preparations, etc.]**

## Safety

General lab and field safety protocols apply (see the Safety section). Mo'orea-specific safety information will be covered in a pre-departure briefing with Adrian and experienced lab members.

**[Additional Mo'orea-specific safety details to be added.]**

# Lab Meetings

## Overview

We hold lab meetings weekly during the academic year, typically for about an hour to ninety minutes. During the summer, we pause---most of the lab is in Mo'orea or otherwise deep in fieldwork, and the rhythm of the quarter doesn't apply. When we're back on campus in the fall, lab meetings pick up again.

Lab meeting is the one time each week when the whole group is in the same room thinking together. I consider it one of the most important things we do.

## Format

We use a rotating sign-up system. At the start of each quarter, everyone claims one or two weeks. The person who signs up for a given week is responsible for setting the agenda and leading the meeting. You decide what you need from the group that day---it's your time to use well.

Some common formats:

- **Project workshopping.** Walk us through a study design, a confusing result, or an analysis you're stuck on. Bring the messy version. We'll help you think through it.
- **Manuscript or proposal feedback.** Circulate a draft (or a section of one) at least a few days in advance so people can read it carefully. Use the meeting to discuss framing, logic, and structure rather than line edits.
- **Practice talks.** Before a conference, defense, or job talk, use lab meeting to do a full run-through. We'll give you honest feedback on content, pacing, and clarity.
- **Paper discussion.** Pick a paper, book chapter, or essay that's shaping your thinking. It doesn't have to be in our subfield---some of the best discussions come from work that challenges how we see our own questions.
- **Brainstorming sessions.** Got a half-formed idea for a new project or collaboration? Bring it. The group is good at pressure-testing ideas and finding angles you haven't considered.
- **Visitors.** When a job candidate or seminar speaker visits, we sometimes use lab meeting as a chance for an informal conversation with them.

There is no single "right" way to lead a lab meeting. Some people use slides; some draw on the whiteboard; some just talk. The only requirement is that you come prepared and give the rest of us enough context to be useful.

## Attendance

Lab meeting attendance is expected for all graduate students and postdocs. If you have a genuine conflict---a TA section, a medical appointment, fieldwork---that's fine, just let us know. But treat it as a real commitment, not an optional event.

Undergraduates are welcome and encouraged to attend, even if you're just observing. You'll learn a lot about how scientific thinking actually works by watching people wrestle with ideas in real time.

## On Vulnerability

I want to be direct about something: leading a lab meeting can feel intimidating. You're standing in front of people you respect, presenting work that isn't finished, asking for help with something you haven't figured out yet. That can trigger real insecurity, especially early in your career.

That feeling is normal, and it's actually a sign you're doing it right. The best lab meetings happen when someone is honest about where they are---where the gaps are, what's confusing, what isn't working. If you only ever present polished, finished work, you've missed the point.

Our job as a lab is to make that vulnerability productive. We ask questions to understand, not to perform. We challenge ideas because we want the work to be stronger, not because we want to look smart. And we remember that the "stupid question" someone is afraid to ask is often the one that cracks the problem open.

## Departmental Seminars

Beyond our own lab meetings, EEMB departmental seminars are an important part of intellectual life at UCSB. I encourage everyone to attend when your schedule permits. The talks expose you to ideas and systems well outside your own work, and that breadth matters---some of the most interesting questions in ecology emerge at the boundaries between subfields. When you do attend a seminar, talk about it with labmates afterward. Even a quick conversation over coffee can sharpen your thinking about your own research.

### UCSB ID Card

Get your ID at the information desk at the University Center. Have your Perm number ready. Check with EEMB about the $30 reimbursement.

---

### Individual Development Plan (IDP)

All lab members complete and review an IDP annually. The IDP sets milestones, tracks progress, and provides structure for conversations about your professional development with Adrian.

#### Getting Started

Begin with a self-assessment. Complete the assessments at:

- **myIDP** (AAAS): [myidp.sciencecareers.org](https://myidp.sciencecareers.org/) --- Skills, Interests, and Values assessments
- **University of Wisconsin IDP guide**: [grad.wisc.edu/professional-development/individual-development-plan](https://grad.wisc.edu/professional-development/individual-development-plan/)
- **Rutgers IDP guide**: [grad.rutgers.edu/academics/individual-development-plans](https://grad.rutgers.edu/academics/individual-development-plans)

Save your results for future comparison.

#### Self-Assessment Questions

Use the information from these assessments to reflect on the following. These are starting points for your IDP conversations with Adrian --- not a to-do list. Your answers will change as your circumstances evolve.

**Strengths and growth areas:**
- What are your biggest strengths coming into this position? (List at least 3)
- In which areas do you most want to improve during your time in the lab? (List at least 3)

**Past accomplishments** (if applicable):
- What are the biggest improvements you've made or skills you've learned in the past year?
- How did your progress compare to what you had planned?
- What goals did you not make adequate progress on, and what steps can you take this year?
- List your tangible outcomes from the previous year (publications, presentations, certifications, etc.)

**Present goals:**
- What skills, techniques, or approaches do you most need to be successful in your current position? Do you already have them, or do you need to develop them?
- What steps can you take on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis to maintain good habits and make progress toward your goals?

**Future goals:**
- What is your "next step" career goal? What skills will be most important, and do you already have them?
- What is your longer-term career goal? How do the skills differ from those needed for your next step?

#### Goal-Setting

Here is a tool for short and long-term goal-setting: [myIDP Career Advancement Goals](https://myidp.sciencecareers.org/CareerAdvancementGoals/QuickTips)

Use the SMART framework when setting goals:

| | |
|---|---|
| **S --- Specific** | Is it focused and unambiguous? |
| **M --- Measurable** | Could someone determine whether you achieved it? |
| **A --- Action-oriented** | Did you specify the action you will take? |
| **R --- Realistic** | Considering difficulty and timeframe, is it attainable? |
| **T --- Time-bound** | Did you specify a deadline? |

Track your goals using a simple table:

| Category | Specific Goal | Timeline | Intended Outcome | Achieved? |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Research | | | | |
| Writing | | | | |
| Teaching | | | | |
| Professional Development | | | | |
