# Mentoring and Advising Structure

The lab uses several structured tools for transparent, consistent mentoring:

- **Mentor/Mentee Agreement:** Completed at the start of your program and revisited annually. See details below.

- **Lab Working Agreement:** The whole lab reviews and signs this yearly. It spells out shared values around communication, process, and collaboration.

- **Individual Development Plans (IDPs):** Annual review with quarterly check-ins. Covers research milestones, skills development, and career planning.

- **Annual meetings with Graduate Advisor:** All students meet with the Graduate Advisor (currently Mengshu Ye) yearly (for at least the first two years) to provide feedback on mentorship. Adrian also meets with the Graduate Advisor to address any concerns.

## Mentor/Mentee Agreement

The [UCSB Graduate Division recommends](https://www.graddiv.ucsb.edu/mentoring-students) that faculty and graduate students complete a mentoring agreement to clarify roles, set expectations, and establish how they will communicate and resolve problems. We use this in the Stier Lab. You and Adrian will each fill out the agreement during your first quarter and sign it together. It is revisited and updated at the start of each academic year.

The agreement is not a contract. It is a structured conversation. Its purpose is to make sure you and Adrian are on the same page about things that often go unspoken — and that cause problems precisely because they were never discussed.

The agreement covers:

- **Goals.** What do you want your professional life to look like in five years? What does Adrian hope to see you achieve? You also set specific goals for the current quarter and year — concrete, revisitable targets that give your meetings focus.

- **Expectations.** How do you each expect the mentoring relationship to work? What kinds of support do you need? What balance do you expect between your own independent projects and lab-directed work? How do you expect to work with other faculty?

- **Communication and work style.** How do you prefer to communicate (frequency, mode, formality)? What is your expected work/life balance? Are there periods when you will be less available? How many hours per week do you expect to work? How often will you meet, and where?

- **Responsibilities.** What specific ongoing responsibilities does Adrian commit to? What responsibilities do you take on as a member of the research team?

- **Problem solving.** If problems or conflicts arise with any of the above, how will they be discussed and resolved? Having this conversation before a conflict exists makes it much easier to navigate when one does.

- **Summer expectations.** Summer is different from the academic year. Expectations for availability, productivity, and communication during the summer are worth discussing explicitly.

- **Anything else.** Is there anything about your life situation — health, family obligations, financial constraints, anything — that may be relevant to your work together? You are not required to share personal information, but the agreement creates a space to do so if you choose.

The Graduate Division's [mentoring resources page](https://www.graddiv.ucsb.edu/our-services/mentorship-inclusivity) and their [guide to mentor and mentee responsibilities](https://www.graddiv.ucsb.edu/responsibilities-mentors-student) provide additional context. Their guidelines emphasize that mentoring relationships work best when both parties treat themselves as partners, that students should seek multiple mentors (one person cannot meet all your needs), and that either party can seek outside counsel from the Graduate Division, the Ombuds Office, or Title IX if the relationship is not working.

## What Adrian Commits To

- Timely feedback on written work within agreed-upon timelines.
- Quarterly milestone tracking aligned with your IDP.
- Documented meeting summaries shared after each advising meeting, ending with a clear list of agreed-upon goals and next steps so we leave on the same page.
- Written role descriptions for GSR/TA responsibilities each quarter, including clear separation of paid vs. voluntary tasks.
- A written description of how student accomplishments support recommendation letters, provided at the start of the advising relationship.
- Monthly updates to the Department Chair and Graduate Advisor (Mengshu Ye) on lab climate and student progress.

## What Students Commit To

- Active participation in IDP development and quarterly reviews.
- Proactive communication about problems, delays, or concerns. Speak up early rather than late.
- Engaging constructively with feedback, even when it is uncomfortable.
- Contributing to lab community: attending lab meetings, helping maintain shared spaces, supporting labmates.

## Giving and Receiving Feedback

Good advising depends on honest, two-way communication. Adrian needs your feedback to be an effective advisor, and you need feedback from Adrian, your committee, and your labmates to grow as a scientist.

**Give feedback to your advisor.** If something in the advising relationship is not working — the pace of feedback, the frequency of meetings, the clarity of expectations, anything — say so. You can raise it directly, through the annual anonymous survey, or through the Graduate Advisor. Adrian cannot fix problems he does not know about, and he would rather hear about a small issue now than a big one later. This is not a one-time conversation. It is an ongoing part of the relationship.

**Communicate regularly with your committee.** Your committee exists to support your development, not just to evaluate you at milestones. Do not wait until your annual meeting to reach out. Send brief updates between meetings. If you are stuck on a question that falls within a committee member's expertise, email them. If your research direction is shifting, let them know before the next formal meeting rather than surprising them. Committee members who are kept in the loop give better advice and are stronger advocates for you when it matters — for job references, fellowship letters, and your defense.

**This applies to everyone in the lab.** Whether you are a graduate student, postdoc, lab manager, or undergraduate researcher, you should feel that giving feedback — up, down, and sideways — is a normal and expected part of being in this lab. Adrian is not the only person who benefits from hearing what is and is not working. Labmates mentoring undergraduates, collaborators sharing a project, and TAs working with an instructor all benefit from the same principle: say something early, say it directly, and assume the other person wants to hear it.

## Letters of Recommendation

At some point you will need letters from Adrian — for fellowships, jobs, graduate school applications, or awards. Strong letters require planning on both sides.

**Give adequate notice.** Ask at least three to four weeks before the deadline. Adrian writes careful, detailed letters, and doing that well takes time. Last-minute requests produce weaker letters.

**Provide materials.** When you ask for a letter, send Adrian:

- The opportunity description (job posting, fellowship solicitation, etc.)
- Your current CV
- A short summary of what you want the letter to emphasize (your research, teaching, mentoring, specific skills)
- Any specific points that would strengthen your application (a connection to the funder's mission, a relevant skill, an experience the reader should know about)
- The deadline and submission instructions

**Have a conversation.** For important applications (faculty jobs, major fellowships), schedule a brief meeting to talk through your candidacy. This helps Adrian tailor the letter to the specific opportunity and the specific review committee.

**Follow up.** If you have not received confirmation that the letter was submitted a few days before the deadline, send a reminder. This is not rude. It is responsible.

**Be honest about fit.** If you are not sure Adrian is the best person to write a particular letter (for example, if you need someone who can speak to your teaching or to a subfield Adrian does not work in), ask. He will tell you honestly whether he is the right choice, and he can suggest alternatives.

**Adrian's commitment.** If Adrian agrees to write you a letter, he will write a strong one. He does not write lukewarm letters. If he has concerns about writing a compelling letter for a particular opportunity, he will tell you directly so you can make an informed decision about who to ask.
