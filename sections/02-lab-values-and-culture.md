# Lab Values & Culture

## Core Values

I want to be upfront about what matters to me in how we do science and treat each other. These are not aspirational slogans on a poster. They are the things I come back to when making decisions about the lab, and the things I hope you will hold me to as well.

- **Curiosity.** I got into this work because I find the natural world genuinely fascinating, and I hope you did too. Curiosity is the engine of good science. I want this lab to be a place where you can explore, sit with uncertainty, and ask the "stupid questions" that often turn out to be the most important ones.

- **Collaboration.** Our best work happens when we combine diverse perspectives, skills, and experiences. I value working together, helping each other, and sharing credit generously.

- **Constructive Criticism.** I expect us to give each other honest feedback on ideas, writing, analyses, and presentations. I try to offer criticism with the intent to improve. I ask that you receive it with openness rather than defensiveness. That goes both ways. I need your honest reactions to my ideas too.

- **Courage.** I want people in this lab to speak up when they disagree, when something feels wrong, or when they need help. Challenge ideas respectfully, regardless of who holds them, including me.

- **Clarity.** We strive to think clearly and communicate well in our writing, our talks, our experimental designs, and our conversations with each other.

- **Compassion.** I care about you as a whole person, not just as a research producer. We hold each other accountable while remaining sensitive to the pressures and challenges of graduate life.

- **Community.** I value every voice in the lab. We build and sustain our community through shared meals, social time, mutual support, and a culture where everyone feels they belong.

- **Integrity.** We conduct our research honestly, treat our data with respect, and hold ourselves to the highest standards of scientific and professional ethics. There are no shortcuts here.

## Day-to-Day Lab Life

### Be Around

Some of the best scientific insights I have had (and that I have seen students have) came from unplanned conversations. Someone mentions a weird pattern in their data over coffee. Twenty minutes later you have redesigned an experiment. That only happens if people are physically present. I do not expect rigid 9-to-5 hours, and working from home sometimes is completely fine. But I encourage you to make the lab and office your default workspace. The spontaneous interactions matter more than you think.

### Shared Spaces

The lab is communal space, and keeping it functional is everyone's job. A few specifics:

- Wash your dishes. Seriously. The sink is not a staging area.
- Label your samples clearly: your name, date, and what it is. Mysterious unlabeled containers will get tossed.
- If supplies are running low, help reorder. If equipment is broken, report it. Do not assume someone else will handle it.
- Leave shared spaces at least as clean as you found them.

### Socializing

I think it matters that people in the lab actually enjoy spending time together. Lab potlucks, beach days, happy hours, whatever form it takes. The social side of lab life is not a distraction from the science. It is part of what makes a lab function well. I encourage it, though I am not going to prescribe what it looks like.

### Seminars

Attend EEMB seminars, thesis defenses, and other departmental talks when your schedule allows. See the Lab Meetings section for more on departmental seminars.

## Photos, Videos, and Media

We take a lot of photos and videos — in the field, in the lab, at social events, and during outreach. These images are valuable for the lab website, social media, presentations, grant proposals, and departmental communications.

Before using a photo or video of a lab member in any public-facing context (website, social media, presentation to an external audience, news article), ask the person for permission. This applies even if they were present when the photo was taken. Some people are comfortable being featured publicly; others are not. Respect that without requiring an explanation.

If you would prefer not to appear in lab photos or on the lab website, let me or the lab manager know. You will not be asked to justify it, and it will not affect anything.

## Roles and Awareness

You will play multiple roles in this lab: student, teacher, mentor to undergrads, peer. Be aware of how your behavior carries different weight in different contexts, especially when there is a power differential. The way you give feedback to an undergraduate mentee is not the same as how you push back on a fellow grad student's interpretation. Both differ from how you raise a concern with me.
