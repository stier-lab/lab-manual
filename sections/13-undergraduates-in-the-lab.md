# Undergraduates in the Lab

Undergraduates are a welcome and important part of our lab community. Most will work under the guidance of a graduate student or postdoc. Adrian should know about all undergraduate projects. Consult him on any issues that come up.

## Expectations for Mentors

- Do not treat undergraduates as free labor. Their experience should be genuinely educational.
- Make sure they understand the purpose of their work, not just the mechanics.
- Provide regular feedback and check-ins. Meet with your undergraduate mentee at least once per week.
- Help them develop skills over time. Do not assign the same repetitive task indefinitely.
- Create a progression: start with structured tasks, build toward greater independence, and work toward an independent project if the student is interested and committed.
- If a student is doing good work and asks for a letter of recommendation, tell them early what you look for. Strong letters come from specific examples of initiative, intellectual growth, and reliability. Help them build a track record you can write about honestly.

## Expectations for Undergraduates

- Treat the lab, equipment, and shared spaces with care.
- Communicate proactively about scheduling, availability, and any issues. If you cannot make a scheduled shift or meeting, let your mentor know in advance.
- Attend lab meetings when possible. Even just observing is valuable.
- Ask questions. Everyone started where you are.
- Commit to a consistent schedule. Most undergraduate researchers work 8-12 hours per week. Whatever you agree to with your mentor, follow through reliably. Consistency matters more than total hours.

## Getting Started

New undergraduates should plan on an onboarding period of 2-4 weeks where you learn lab protocols, safety procedures, and the basics of the project you will be contributing to. Your graduate mentor will guide this process. Complete all required safety trainings (see the Required Trainings section) before beginning any lab or fieldwork.

## Research Opportunities

We encourage undergraduates to develop their own research projects, present at lab meetings, and present posters at events like URCA Week (the UCSB Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities poster colloquium). We also encourage students to apply for funding through programs like UCSB's URCA grants. Graduate mentors should help create these opportunities.

A typical trajectory for an engaged undergraduate might look like:

- **Quarter 1:** Learn protocols, assist with ongoing research, attend lab meetings.
- **Quarter 2-3:** Take on more independent responsibilities, begin developing your own research question with your mentor.
- **Quarter 3-4+:** Design and conduct an independent project, present results at lab meeting and/or URCA Week.

Not every undergraduate will follow this trajectory, and that is fine. Some students join the lab for a single quarter to explore whether research is for them. Others stay for two or three years and produce publishable work. Both are valuable.

## Academic Credit

Undergraduates can enroll in EEMB 199 (Independent Studies) for academic credit. Talk to your graduate mentor and Adrian about whether this makes sense for your situation. You and Adrian will outline the scope of work and learning goals for the quarter. Credit typically requires a short written report or presentation at the end of the quarter.

## Funding and Equity

Most undergraduates join as volunteers, for course credit, or with stipend support. We recognize that volunteering is not financially feasible for all students. We will work to provide equitable access to research experience regardless of financial situation. If the time commitment is a barrier, talk to Adrian — there may be options for paid positions through grants, work-study, or URCA funding.

## If Something Is Not Working

If the mentor-mentee relationship is not working — communication has broken down, expectations are unclear, or the experience is not what you hoped — talk to Adrian. This is not a failure on anyone's part. Sometimes a better match or a different project structure makes all the difference. The goal is for every undergraduate to leave the lab having learned something meaningful.

Undergraduate researchers must complete the same basic safety trainings as other lab members. See the Required Trainings section for details.
