# Publishing and Peer Review

## The Publishing Process

Publishing is how we contribute to the scientific record. It is also how you build a career. This section walks through the process so you know what to expect, especially if you have not published before.

### Writing the Paper

Start writing earlier than you think you should. You do not need a complete dataset or a final analysis to begin drafting an introduction, sketching out methods, or outlining the argument. Writing clarifies thinking. Many of the best insights about a project come during the writing, not before it.

A few practical notes:

- **Write in stages.** A rough draft does not need to be good. It needs to exist. Get something on paper, then improve it. Perfectionism at the drafting stage is the single biggest obstacle to productivity.
- **Use a reference manager.** Zotero is the lab standard. Insert citations as you write, not after. Retrofitting citations into a finished draft is miserable work.
- **Write for your reader, not for yourself.** Your methods section should be reproducible. Your results should be interpretable without reading the methods. Your discussion should connect back to the questions you posed in the introduction. This sounds obvious, but most first drafts fail at it.
- **Circulate drafts to labmates** before giving them to me. Fresh eyes catch things you cannot see. Labmates are also faster than me at turning around feedback on a draft. Use this to your advantage.

### Internal Review

Before any manuscript goes to a journal, it goes through internal review:

1. **Labmate feedback.** Share with one or two labmates and incorporate their suggestions.
2. **My review.** Give me a clean draft (not a rough first pass). I will return substantive feedback, usually within the timeline we agreed on in your mentoring agreement. If I am slow, remind me.
3. **Committee review.** For dissertation chapters, circulate to your committee and incorporate their feedback before journal submission. This avoids the painful scenario where a committee member raises concerns about published work at your defense.
4. **Co-author review.** All co-authors must see and approve the final version before submission. No exceptions. This includes the abstract.

### Choosing a Journal

Pick a journal before you finish writing. The journal's scope and audience should shape how you frame the paper. Consider impact factor, audience, open access options, turnaround time, and cost. I will have opinions. So will your co-authors. Discuss this as a group.

### Submission and Revision

- **Cover letters matter.** Write a clear, concise cover letter that explains why the paper fits the journal and what makes it significant. Do not just summarize the abstract.
- **Suggested reviewers.** Most journals ask for suggested reviewers. Choose people who are qualified, do not have conflicts of interest, and are likely to engage constructively with your work. I can help you identify appropriate reviewers.
- **Rejection happens.** Most papers are rejected at least once. It stings, but it is normal. Read the reviews carefully, decide what is useful, revise the paper, and resubmit elsewhere. Do not let a rejection sit on your desk for months. Process it, improve the paper, and move on.
- **Responding to reviewers.** Write a detailed, point-by-point response to every comment. Be respectful and thorough, even when you disagree. When you disagree with a reviewer, explain your reasoning clearly and provide evidence. Never be dismissive.
- **Turnaround.** Aim to resubmit a revision within 4-8 weeks of receiving reviews. Journals notice when revisions take months, and the editors may send it back out for re-review.

### Preprints

I encourage posting preprints (e.g., on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) or [EcoEvoRxiv](https://ecoevorxiv.org/)) when you submit to a journal. Preprints make your work available immediately, establish priority, and invite early feedback. Most ecology journals accept papers that have been posted as preprints. Check the journal's policy before posting, and discuss timing with your co-authors.

## Peer Review

### Reviewing for Journals

At some point during your graduate career or postdoc, you will be asked to review a manuscript for a journal. This is a core professional responsibility. The system works because scientists review each other's work.

**When to say yes:**
- The paper is in your area of expertise
- You can complete the review in the requested timeframe (usually 2-4 weeks)
- You do not have a conflict of interest with the authors

**When to say no:**
- You are overcommitted (it is better to decline than to agree and be late)
- The paper is outside your expertise
- You have a conflict of interest

**How we handle reviews in the lab:**
- If you are a student and want to co-review with me, ask. This is a great learning opportunity. I will submit the review under my name and acknowledge your contribution to the editor.
- Once you have co-reviewed a few papers, you are ready to review independently. When you accept your first solo review invitation, let me know — it is a milestone worth noting.
- Write reviews you would want to receive: specific, constructive, and focused on improving the science. Identify genuine problems, but do not nitpick for the sake of it. Recommend clearly: accept, minor revision, major revision, or reject. Do not hedge.
- Keep reviews confidential. Do not share the manuscript or discuss its contents with anyone other than me (if co-reviewing).

### Responding When Your Work Is Reviewed

Read reviews when you are calm. Your first reaction to critical feedback is almost never your best reaction. Give yourself a day before drafting a response. Then address every point systematically. The goal is not to win an argument with an anonymous reviewer. The goal is to make the paper better.
