# Postdocs

## Your Role in the Lab

Postdocs occupy a unique position. You are no longer a student, but you are not yet fully independent. The goal of a postdoc in this lab is to help you make that transition. You should leave here with publications, an independent research identity, a professional network, and the skills to run your own program.

Your level of independence will be higher than that of a graduate student. I expect you to drive your own projects, manage your time without much oversight, and bring ideas to me rather than waiting for direction. That said, you are not on your own. I am here to provide feedback, open doors, co-develop ideas, and help you navigate the job market. The balance between independence and mentorship will shift over the course of your appointment, and we should talk about where it is and where you want it to be.

## Expectations

**Research output.** The postdoc years are when you build the publication record that defines the next stage of your career. I expect you to be writing and submitting papers throughout your appointment — not saving everything for the end. We will set specific manuscript targets in your mentoring agreement and revisit them quarterly.

**Mentoring.** I expect postdocs to help mentor graduate students and undergraduates in the lab. This is not free labor. Mentoring is a skill you need for your career, and doing it well here gives you concrete evidence for job applications. But it should not consume your research time. If mentoring responsibilities are becoming too heavy, tell me.

**Lab citizenship.** Attend lab meetings, contribute to discussions, and be a constructive presence. You bring experience and perspective that students benefit from enormously. Your engagement with the lab community matters, even when your own work feels all-consuming.

**Professional development.** Actively build skills you will need as a PI: grant writing, project management, hiring and supervising people, teaching (if relevant to your goals), and navigating the job market. I am happy to help with any of these.

## What I Provide

- Regular one-on-one meetings (weekly or biweekly, your preference).
- Feedback on manuscripts, grant proposals, and job applications.
- Honest career advice, including about non-academic paths if that is where your interests lead.
- Introductions to collaborators and colleagues at conferences and through my network.
- Support for independent funding applications (K99, Smith Fellows, NOAA, etc.). I will review drafts and write strong letters.
- A clear understanding of authorship expectations on shared projects. We will discuss this at the start and revisit as projects develop.

## Funding and Logistics

Postdoc positions are typically funded through specific grants with defined terms. Make sure you understand your appointment length, salary, benefits eligibility, and what happens if the grant ends before your planned departure. Ask these questions before you start, not after.

UCSB postdocs are represented by UAW Local 4811 (the same union as graduate student employees). Know your contract, your benefits, and your rights. The union website at [uaw4811.org](https://uaw4811.org/) has the current contract and resources.

## The Job Market

Start preparing earlier than you think. If you are on a two-year postdoc, the job market cycle means you may be applying during your first year. We will talk about your timeline early and adjust expectations accordingly. I will help with application materials, practice job talks in lab meeting, and make calls on your behalf. But you need to drive the process. Set up job alerts, track deadlines, and keep a running list of target positions.

If your career goals change during the postdoc — toward industry, government, NGOs, or something else — that is completely fine. Tell me so I can help you prepare for the path you actually want.
