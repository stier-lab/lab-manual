# Library Services & Suggestions

## Your Subject Librarian

Kristen Labonte is the EEMB subject librarian. Set up your Library account at the front desk. Checkout periods vary by position. You can also schedule a one-on-one research consultation with a librarian through [LibCal](https://libcal.library.ucsb.edu/appointments) — they can help with literature search strategies, navigating citation databases, and locating specialized resources.

## Off-Campus Journal Access

You will need to access journal articles from off-campus regularly. There are three ways to do this:

- **VPN (recommended):** Install the Ivanti VPN client. Once connected, your computer behaves as if on-campus and all publisher sites recognize your access automatically. This is the most reliable method. See the Technology section for VPN setup.
- **Library proxy:** When you navigate through the UCSB Library website or UC Library Search, links are automatically proxied. If you land on an unproxied publisher page, use the library's Off-Campus Access Bookmark Tool (a browser bookmarklet) to re-route through the proxy.
- **UC Library Search:** Searching through [UC Library Search](https://search.library.ucsb.edu) authenticates you automatically for article PDFs.

## Interlibrary Loan (ILL)

If UCSB does not have a journal article or book you need, request it through Interlibrary Loan. The fastest way is to search UC Library Search and select "Request through Interlibrary Loan" under "How to get it." Articles are delivered electronically as PDFs. Books are sent physically to the Library Services Desk. For book chapters, use the article request form and enter the chapter title under "Article Title." Contact: library-ill@ucsb.edu or (805) 893-3436.

## Key Databases for Marine Ecology

The [EEMB LibGuide](https://guides.library.ucsb.edu/eemb) is your best starting point for discipline-specific resources. Databases you should know:

- **Web of Science:** Essential for citation tracking, h-index metrics, and comprehensive literature searching across all sciences.
- **Aquatic Sciences & Fisheries Abstracts (ASFA):** Covers aquaculture, marine biology, fisheries, oceanography, and conservation. Especially relevant for our work.
- **BIOSIS Citation Index:** Comprehensive life sciences indexing including ecology, marine biology, and conservation biology.
- **Google Scholar:** Configure it to recognize UCSB access by going to Settings > Library links and searching for "UC Santa Barbara."

## Data Management Services

The library's Research Data Services (RDS) team offers free consultations on data management plans for grant proposals (NSF, NIH), data organization and documentation, choosing repositories for data publication, and making data FAIR-compliant. They also run workshops on data tools and reproducible workflows. Contact: rds@library.ucsb.edu.

## GIS and Geospatial Resources

The DREAM Lab (formerly the Interdisciplinary Research Collaboratory) houses one of the largest academic map and geospatial data collections in the country. They provide workstations with ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, and access to historical aerial photographs, government datasets, and spatial data. One-on-one GIS consultations are available. Contact: dreamlab@library.ucsb.edu. The library also maintains a [Geospatial Data LibGuide](https://guides.library.ucsb.edu/gis).

## Open Access and eScholarship

Under UC's Presidential Open Access Policy, graduate students can deposit published work into [eScholarship](https://escholarship.org/), UC's institutional repository. You retain copyright and grant UC a non-exclusive right to publish. All UCSB theses and dissertations are deposited into eScholarship and made openly available (with optional embargo of 6 months to 2 years). Contact: openaccess@library.ucsb.edu.
