# Graduate Program Guidance

Note: This section supplements the official EEMB Graduate Student Handbooks (PhD and MS), which are available on the EEMB website. Read the current handbook for your degree program. It contains the definitive requirements for committee formation, qualifying exams, and degree completion.

## All Graduate Students

**Weekly meetings:** At the start of each quarter, Adrian schedules weekly or biweekly one-on-one meetings with each student. This time is yours. You set the agenda. If you have nothing to discuss one week, cancel. But if you cancel several weeks in a row, expect Adrian to check in.

**Committee formation:** Form your committee during your first year. Per EEMB requirements, you need a minimum of 3 members. At least 2 must be ladder faculty from EEMB (including the chair). The third can be from another department or UC campus. Think of your committee as a team with complementary expertise. Adrian will offer suggestions, but the decision is yours.

**Developing your research question:** There is no single right way to find a research question. Some people arrive with a burning question they have been thinking about for years. Others start with a system they are drawn to (a reef, a species interaction, a place) and the question emerges from spending time in that system. In practice, most of us do a messy mix of both. We explore a system, read the literature, notice gaps or puzzles, and go back and forth between questions and observations until something clicks.

I encourage you to read broadly, including well outside your immediate subfield. Go to seminars in departments you would not normally visit. Talk to people in other labs about their work. You will not switch fields, but the most interesting questions often live at the boundaries between disciplines. The first research question you land on will almost certainly evolve, and that is normal and healthy. A question that does not change as you learn more probably means you are not learning enough.

My role in this process differs depending on where you are. For PhD students, developing an original research question is a core part of the training. I will push back, suggest readings, point you toward gaps I find exciting, and help you refine your thinking. But the question needs to be yours. For MS students, given the compressed timeline, I will be more hands-on in helping define the scope and I will sometimes suggest a question directly. Either way, we will talk about this a lot in our one-on-one meetings, especially in your first year.

**Teaching Assistantships:** All EEMB students are required to TA at least 2 quarters. TA support is a large part of most funding packages. Classes vary in their workload. Some are straightforward and leave you plenty of time for research. Others are intensive and require weekly prep. The best way to figure out which classes work for you is to ask other grad students who have TAed them recently. Your fellow students are the most honest and up-to-date source on what to expect. I am happy to weigh in too, but the student grapevine is your best bet for the real picture.

**Annual progress reports:** EEMB requires an annual Progress Report and Study Plan, filed with your committee. This makes sure you and your committee agree on where you are and what comes next. Your committee will meet at least once per year to review progress. Between formal meetings, keep your committee in the loop with brief updates — a short email when you have a result, a question when you are stuck, or a heads-up when your direction shifts. Committee members who hear from you regularly give better advice and write stronger letters on your behalf.

**Individual Development Plans:** All students complete and review an IDP annually. The IDP sets milestones, tracks progress, and provides structure for conversations about your professional development. Quarterly check-ins supplement the annual review.

**Practice talks:** Practice your research presentations before every conference, in lab meeting or with labmates. The first practice talk usually reveals that a talk you thought was "almost done" needs to be restructured. This is normal. Give yourself time. Do not wait until the last minute.

**Publications:** Write and submit papers as you progress through your program. Do not wait until the end. Ideally, most of your publishable work will be in review or published by the time you defend. This makes your next career transition much easier.

**Committee review of manuscripts:** Give each manuscript to your committee and incorporate feedback before submitting to a journal. See the Publishing and Peer Review section for the full internal review process.

**Required coursework (Year 1):** All EEMB graduate students must complete EEMB 500 (Campus Orientation), 507 (Introduction to Graduate Research), 508 and 509 (Levels of Biological Organization I & II), 290 (Introduction to Faculty Research), and 502 (Teaching Techniques).

## MS Students

Target: file your thesis by the end of your second year. The maximum time allowed by EEMB is 4 years. This is fast, so there is little time to waste. I am more inclined to directly help MS students define or refine a research question than I am with PhD students, given the compressed timeline. Starting research the summer before you matriculate can give you a meaningful head start.

MS students can choose Plan I (thesis, minimum 30 units) or Plan II (comprehensive exam, minimum 36 units). Discuss with Adrian which path makes sense for your goals.

## PhD Students

Target: 6 years to completion (EEMB normative time). Key milestones per EEMB requirements:

- **Year 1:** Complete core coursework. Form your committee. Begin research. Complete at least one quarter of TA.

- **Year 2:** Complete both written qualifying exams (two fields chosen in consultation with your committee, one in ecology/evolution, one in a related field). This is a firm deadline set by the department. Students who fall behind on exams will receive a warning and must work with their committee and the Graduate Advisor to get back on track.

- **Year 3:** Complete the oral qualifying exam (present your dissertation proposal to your committee, followed by broad questioning). Advance to candidacy by filing Doctoral Form II with the Graduate Division ($50 fee). Advancement triggers the 3-year NRST waiver for international students.

- **Years 3-6:** Dissertation research, writing, and regular annual committee meetings with progress reports.

- **Defense:** Aim to defend in Fall or Spring, not Summer. Faculty are not paid in summer. Many are in the field, and fewer colleagues will be around to help you prepare and celebrate. Note: EEMB allows a public seminar of your dissertation research as an alternative to a traditional oral defense. Discuss with your committee.

- **Beyond normative time:** If you go beyond 6 years, you must take extra steps. At year 7, you must petition the Graduate Committee and Graduate Dean to continue. At year 8, you may need to retake written exams or show currency. The university maximum is 10 years, but the goal is to finish well before that. If you are approaching normative time, talk to Adrian and your committee early about a realistic completion plan.

## Escalation and Support Within EEMB

If you have questions or concerns beyond what Adrian can address:

1. **Staff Graduate Advisor (Mengshu Ye):** Administrative and technical questions (timetables, forms, requirements, petitions).
2. **Faculty Graduate Advisor (Hillary Young):** Academic questions, issues with your studies or your relationship with your major professor.
3. **Department Chair (Todd Oakley):** If the Faculty Graduate Advisor cannot resolve the issue.
