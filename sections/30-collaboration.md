# Collaboration

## Working with People Outside the Lab

Some of your best work will involve people who are not in this lab. Collaborations with other labs, other departments, other institutions, and non-academic partners are a normal and encouraged part of how we do science. Coral reef ecology is inherently interdisciplinary, and the questions we ask often require expertise we do not have in-house.

That said, collaborations work best when expectations are clear from the start. Most collaboration problems stem from unspoken assumptions — about who does what, who gets credit, and who owns the data.

## Setting Up a Collaboration

When starting a new collaboration, have an explicit conversation (ideally in writing) about:

- **Roles and responsibilities.** Who is doing what? Who is leading the project? Who is providing data, analysis, field support, or other resources?
- **Authorship.** Discuss expected authorship early, using the principles in the Authorship Policy section. Revisit as the project develops. Do not wait until the paper is written.
- **Data sharing.** Who collects the data? Who has access to it during the project? What happens to the data after the project ends? If you are using someone else's data, clarify the terms before you start analyzing it.
- **Timeline.** What is the expected timeline for the project? What happens if one party falls behind?
- **Communication.** How often will you check in? What is the preferred mode of communication? Who is the point of contact on each side?

For large or multi-institutional collaborations, consider putting this in a written agreement or memo of understanding. It does not need to be formal or legal. A shared document that everyone has signed off on is enough. The point is to have something to refer back to if memories diverge.

## Using Shared Data

If a collaborator shares data with you, treat it with respect:

- **Do not share it further** without explicit permission.
- **Do not use it for purposes beyond** what was agreed. If you see an interesting pattern that could become a separate paper, ask before pursuing it.
- **Acknowledge the source** appropriately — through authorship, acknowledgements, or data citations depending on the contribution.
- **Return the favor.** If you generate data that might be useful to your collaborators, offer to share it.

## When to Loop Me In

You do not need my permission to collaborate with other scientists. I encourage it. But there are a few situations where you should loop me in:

- **New collaborations that use lab resources** (equipment, boat time, grant funding, field site access).
- **Collaborations that overlap with other projects in the lab.** If someone else in the lab is already working with the same group or on a closely related question, we need to coordinate.
- **Anything involving a formal agreement** (data sharing agreements, MOUs, permits under the lab's name).
- **Collaborations with industry or government** that might involve intellectual property, conflicts of interest, or political sensitivities.

Beyond those cases, go ahead. Meeting people at conferences and starting conversations about shared interests is one of the best things you can do for your career. If a conversation turns into a potential project, let me know so I can help if needed — or just stay out of the way.

## Being a Good Collaborator

A few things that go a long way:

- **Do what you said you would do, when you said you would do it.** Reliability is the single most important trait in a collaborator. Your reputation is built on whether people can count on you.
- **Communicate when things change.** If you are going to be late on a deliverable, say so early. People can adjust. What they cannot handle is silence followed by a missed deadline.
- **Be generous with credit.** When in doubt, include someone rather than exclude them. A generous authorship policy builds goodwill and future collaborations.
- **Respond to emails.** Collaborators who go silent are collaborators who do not get invited back. Even a quick "I saw this, will get to it next week" keeps the relationship healthy.
