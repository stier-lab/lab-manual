# Required Trainings

You must complete several trainings before you can get to work. It feels like a lot of paperwork, but these trainings keep you, your labmates, and our study organisms safe. Work through them in your first few weeks.

## Basic Training

**Step 1:** Log in to the [UC Learning Center](https://www.learningcenter.ucsb.edu). Employees log in with UCNetID. Graduate students and volunteers use the Non-Employee login. Email ehstraining@ehs.ucsb.edu with your name, UCNetID, email, affiliation type, and PI name.

**Step 2:** Complete the following trainings:

- Cyber Security Awareness Training
- Fundamentals of Laboratory Safety (grad students: in-person during orientation, postdocs/undergrads: online LS60, technicians: live or online)
- UC Preventing Harassment & Discrimination (formerly UC Sexual Harassment Training)
- Gateway 101 (only if you will be ordering supplies)

## LHAT (Laboratory Hazard Assessment Tool) Training

- Step 1: Remind me or the designated lab member to add you to the Stier Lab LHAT Group.
- Step 2: Schedule time with a senior lab member to review lab-specific procedures, hazards, and emergencies per the EHS Training Needs Assessment Form.
- Once complete, sign the form and give it to me for approval. Get personal protective equipment (PPE) from the stockroom in Chemistry (room 1432).

## Animal Care Training

To work with animals at UCSB, email the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at iacuc@lifesci.ucsb.edu with your name, PI (Dr. Adrian Stier), and protocol information. Complete the IACUC Researcher Training Checklist, register at [citiprogram.org](https://about.citiprogram.org/) (Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative) with UCSB, and complete the required modules.

Note: Even SCUBA surveys involving fish require IACUC approval in many cases. If your research involves fish at all, review IACUC requirements thoroughly before deciding you do not need a protocol. Creating a new IACUC protocol takes at least 2 months. Plan accordingly.

## Research Permits and Compliance

Beyond training, many research activities require permits and institutional approvals. You cannot conduct research until these are in hand. Permit applications can take weeks to months, so start early and build the timeline into your project planning.

- **IACUC:** If your research involves vertebrates (including fish surveys by SCUBA), you need Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval. All IACUC applications go through me. See the Animal Care Training section above for the process. Creating a new protocol takes at least 2 months.
- **International permits:** Research at our Mo'orea field site requires a Protocole d'accueil and may require CITES permits for sample transport. See the Mo'orea Fieldwork section for details.
- **Collecting permits:** Depending on your field site, you may need state or federal collecting permits (e.g., California Department of Fish and Wildlife Scientific Collecting Permit, National Marine Sanctuary permits). Talk to me about what applies to your project.
- **IRB:** If your research involves human subjects (surveys, interviews, assessments), you need Institutional Review Board approval. This is rare in our lab but can apply to training grants or interdisciplinary work. Access the IRB portal through the UCSB Office of Research.

The general rule: if you are unsure whether you need a permit, ask. It is always better to check early than to discover midway through a project that you needed approval you do not have.

## Chemical Health and Safety Plan

When you order a new chemical not already in the lab, print an SDS and add it to the Chemical Health and Safety Binder in Noble 2224. If the chemical is hazardous, check for extra training requirements and complete any needed SOPs.

For new, potentially dangerous protocols, fill out an SOP and add it to both the binder and the shared Drive folder (Admin > EH&S). Before training others, refer them to the documentation first.
